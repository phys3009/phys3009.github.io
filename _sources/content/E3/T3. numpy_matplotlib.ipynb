    "One of the main reasons why python is great is because it is supported by such a large community of people developing opensource (free) packages. A package is a collection of code that can be run using python and augments the capabilities of standard python. In fact, it is often very hard to come up with an idea for which there is not already a python package. Many of these packages are available and can be installed either via Conda or Pip which we discussed at the beginning of the course. In this set of lectures we will look at a particular set of packages which are specifically targeted at scientific computing / datascience. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst users interact with these packages using python code, many of the key datastructures and operations are really written in low-level languages like c or Fortran. As a result one can largely overcome one of the main limitations of python - its speed.\n",

    "\n",
    "The packages are related to one another:\n",
    "- The foundational package is `Numpy` - this introduces arrays and matrices and a range of associated operations. Whilst they look quite similar to lists they are fundamentally different in their use of memory which makes them extremely fast. This also means, the items in a numpy array must be of the same type.\n",
    "- Built on `Numpy` are a key plotting package `Matplotlib`, `Pandas` which enables one to efficiently work with tables of data and `SciPy` which contains many routines for fitting, solving equations and optimisation.\n"

    "If all you want to do is plot some data, the above plots are probably fine. You can do a lot more with Matplotlib. However, before you do, it is worth asking yourself the question if this is the most efficient way to get the job done. Matplotlib enables you to customise absolutely everything and produce very sophisticated plots. However, this usually takes a lot of time. If your aim is to produce a one off, really nice looking plot for a publication or report you might be better off using a dedicated graph producing software. <a href = https://veusz.github.io> Veusz </a> (mentioned above) is free to download, entirely gui based and will allow you to customise things very nicely in a very short amount of time.\n",

    "You can however customise pretty much everything in a Matplotlib plot. This helpful graphic tells you what different features are called so you can look them up. \n",

    "<img src=\"resources/images/matplotlib.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another very useful approach if you want to create a more complicated plot is to look at the <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html\">Matplotlib graph gallery</a>, where example plots come with the accompanying code. There you can understand how to alter linestyles, axes appearance and much more. This also demonstrates other more advanced plot types: contours, heatmaps etc some of which we'll explore in the exercises."

    "Sometimes it is helpful to be able to interact with your data interactively. There are a number of ways to do this. If you are building more complicated programs you may want to use a gui framework such as <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html\">Tkinter</a> or <a href=\"https://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/\">PyQT5</a>. Matplotlib also provides its own <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/widgets/index.html\">widgets</a> which are quick to setup. In my experience these work well when running a python script but there are a lot of compatibility challenges when using these in Jupyter Notebooks for dataanalysis. If you are interested in exploring these I recommend reading up about <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/ipympl/\">`ipympl`</a>.\n",
