    "# 7 Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.1 The difference between procedural and object oriented programming\n",
    "Typically when performing self-contained data analysis or writing relatively short scripts it is preferable to keep code structure relatively simple. Our code might consist of a single file, perhaps with an imported additional module containing a series of functions. The structure of our program is to store data in variables and then to operate on that data with functions. The program starts at the top and sequentially works line by line towards the bottom, with simple tasks and repeated operations delegated to functions to increase code reuse. There is nothing wrong with this method! When programs are small, this kind of code is usually simpler to understand, quicker to write and easier to maintain. This approach to programming is often called *Procedural programming*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Object oriented programming (OOP)* takes a different approach. The idea is that in normal life people think of the world by dividing it up into objects, whether physical or abstract: Cars, People, Internet, Mind. Objects have attributes (a car is red) and they have actions (a car moves). These two things (attributes and actions) both belong to an object. There can be multiple objects of the same type which have the same type of attributes (a car has a colour) and actions, even if the values might be different (a car could be red or blue). Objects act on one another to change each others attributes ( A Person paints a car a different colour, thus changing the attribute colour of the car).\n",
    "\n",
    "In *OOP* we can define a blueprint of an object which defines the types of attributes and actions that a particular type of object should have. We could therefore define a generic car object as something which has the following *attributes*: colour, velocity and the following actions which we call *methods*: accelerate. One can think of an attribute like a variable and a method like a function, but in both cases these are attached to an object. This blueprint is called a *class*. Once we have a *class* or blueprint we can use it to create an actual object, known as an *instance*. So a Car *class* could be used to create a red car with a velocity of 30mph. The same class could then also be used to create a blue car with velocity 20mph.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, this might sound a bit complicated. So why is this approach popular?\n",
    "\n",
    "It extends the logic we used when writing functions. It limits the amount of code I have to hold in my mind at once. A good function groups code into a block that performs a single task. Once I'm confident it works, I only need to know what the function does, its inputs and outputs. As programs get bigger this is essential. Classes enable me to group larger sections of related code together, both methods and variables (This is known as `encapsulation`). If well constructed this simplifies the cognitive load immensely. For example, if my class is called `Camera` and it has methods `start_record()` and `stop_record()` and attributes `framerate=30` and `number_of_pics=20` it is very easy to work out how to use it without knowing the details. This hiding of details is often called `abstraction`."

    "You've been using classes everywhere in python, perhaps without even realising it. Whilst you didn't define them, every time you create a new variable, collection etc in python you are using someone else's class. Let's create a list. This creates an instance of list from the blueprint or class list. Python allows you some shortcuts using [] but list() is what you are really doing. Notice if you ask python for the type it tells you it is a *class* of type *list*. That is it was prepared according to the list blueprint. We can then call a method *append* of that class list."

    "\n",
    "1. DRY - We have met \"Do Not Repeat Yourself\" before in the context of functions but it is worth repeating that logically grouping code should prevent you needing to change it in multiple places, making your code easier to maintain / change.\n",
    "2. KISS stands for \"Keep it simple stupid\". There is a big temptation once one starts writing classes to create huge classes with millions of properties and methods. There are a few reasons for not doing this:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    i. YAGNI    -   \"You ain't gonna need it\". Sometimes people try and pre-empt all the possible functionality they might need. YAGNI says you should keep a simple clear structure and just implement the most basic code that serves your needs. If you find you need something later you can come back and add it in.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ii. SRP -   \"Single Responsibility Principle\". Another mistake is to mix what should be multiple objects together into the same class. Consider the Camera class above. The method take_pic() returns an image from the camera to the attached computer. One might be tempted to therefore add a `save_img()` method to the camera class. Then you might think wouldn't it be nice if a gui dialogue popped open to allow the user to enter the filename. This kind of thinking results in huge classes which are really hard to understand and therefore use. Saving the images is a borderline case, but gui dialogues have nothing logically to do with cameras. What happens if you want to change the gui framework from Tkinter to PyQT? You would have to completely rewrite your class. The core responsibility of your camera class is to control the camera so restrict it to properties and methods that are just associated with that. It can then interact with other classes which handle gui dialogues or whatever is needed."
