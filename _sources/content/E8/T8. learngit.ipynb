    "# 8 Git and Github\n",
    "In this course you've been synchronising your work with Github Classroom. This is a great way to get started with version control, but it's not the only way to use git and github and requires someone else to set everything up for you. In this section we'll learn how to use git and github from the command line. This is the way most professional developers use git and github. It's also the way you'll need to use git and github if you want to use it for your own projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.1 Getting Started\n",
    "### 8.1.1 What are git, github?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Git** is a piece of software that runs on your computer that enables you to record the step-by-step development of / changes to any set of files in a designated folder (a **repository**). Every time you `commit`, git will take a snapshot of your filesystem and the contents of those files, and add it to a history of other snapshots taken at earlier times. Git also allows you to see or recover your files at any point in that history. Git enables you or others to develop the same project contributing to the same history on different computers and combine the results without losing anything, or inadvertently mucking up someone else’s contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Github** is a website / server that hosts git repositories. Local copies of your project can be synchronised with an equivalent repository on GitHub. The code can then be distributed to use on other computers owned by you, those of your collaborators or the wider public. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1.2 Why do I need to learn git?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Software developers and datascientists use git as an essential part of their job, so you need to learn professional tools.\n",
    "- Backup your code\n",
    "- Experiment with code without risk of destroying your main code.\n",
    "- Recover old versions – before you introduced a massive bug!\n",
    "- Enables collaboration\n",
    "- Enables distribution of your code\n",
    "- Gives you access to software tools e.g automated documentation builders, AI assisted coding\n",

    "### 8.1.3 Why are we doing this from the command line, when I can do this from a gui?\n",

    "I believe that if you learn it on the command line you’ll understand what you are doing far better. Gui are fine when everything is working, but they are often hard to unpick when you get yourself in a muddle and there are lots of different Gui that all look and behave differently. If you understand the command line you’ll be able to figure out any Gui regardless of what IDE you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a practical level it is also worth realising that if you get stuck and need to google help, you’ll find lots of help for the command line. Seldom do you find a load of screenshots for your particular gui.\n",

    "\n",
    "Check that you installed everything correctly in the installation guide. Open a terminal (**Ctrl + Alt + T** or alternatively *Terminal > New Terminal*). This should be a command prompt terminal. Type `git --version` followed by `gh --version` you should see the following, although the version numbers could be different. If you get nothing or an error revisit the installation instructions and troubleshoot.\n",

    "1. Make changes (ie write code etc). \n",

    "\n",
    "The most important difference is what they do to the commit history. `git rebase` and `git reset` when used with certain options get you back to the state of a particular commit. However, they do so by effectively rewinding: removing or detaching the subsequent commits. In otherwords they change the recorded history irreversibly. This can get you in a mess. If someone else is working on the same project a huge mess! You may have just erased a commit that someone else needed or had developed code from.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast `git revert` adds a new commit to the end of the history that undoes the previous change. You can work your way back further by reverting multiple commits. This is better because your mistakes stay in the history and you get back the files the way you want them. There are issues however with branching (see below) and you have to list all the commits to revert.\n",
    "\n",
    "My preferred solution is to use `git restore`. This adds a commit to the end of the commit history which looks identical to a previous commit but doesn’t remove anything from history.\n",

    "2.  <span style=\"color:red\">origin/master</span> which tells us where the end of the commit history is on the remote repository on github.\n",
    "(Actually it tells us where it was last time we connected)\n",

Usually this points to <span style=\"color:green\">master</span> but as we’ve seen it can be moved around changing what we see when we open the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code you are developing may get used for a project that you submitted or perhaps was used in the analysis for a research paper. It is possible that after submission you carry on developing the code. However, you may want to be able to rerun the code as it was when you submitted the paper. For example, perhaps the reviewers want you to run another simulation. Alternatively, perhaps the code has reached a particular level of maturity and you want to mark this as a stable version that you distributed to other researchers.\n",

    "### 8.7.2 Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as <span style=\"color:green\">master</span> and  <span style=\"color:red\">origin/master</span> point to the end of a commit history on the local and github versions of our project, it is also possible to set up other markers that can sit at the end of a related but different version of our project. What does this look like? Here are two scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tYou want to do an experimental change to your code. The change is going to need a few commits but you don’t know if it will work or not and therefore if you’ll keep it.\n",
    "2.\tYou have a big project which is used by lots of people. You want people to have access to a stable functioning version of the project at all times, but in parallel you want to develop the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases the code you are working on is related to the main commit history of the project. In fact it shares at least some of the history prior to the changes / developments you are making. However, after a certain point the commit history will be different. This is known as a branch. Every branch has a new marker associated with the end of the branch that like <span style=\"color:green\">master</span> moves forward whenever a new commit is made and always points to the final commit in the history of that development.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create one of these branches from any point in our existing commit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:** a quick experiment by creating a branch called “development”:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "    git branch <branchname>\n",

If we were to commit changes now, <span style=\"color:green\">master</span> and <span style=\"color:cyan\">HEAD</span> would move forward together adding to the same commit history as usual. To start adding to an alternative development history we need to move <span style=\"color:cyan\">HEAD</span> to point at development instead. To do that we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "    git checkout development\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/images/addchangebranch.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/images/changetobranch.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the experiment appears to work we want to take those changes and add them to our main branch. This is called a merge. Merges become more difficult if independent changes are made on both the <span style=\"color:green\">master</span> and development branch since this creates conflicts that need resolving. We’ll look at an example later. In this case only development has changed so it should be possible for git to merge the changes automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want the changes made to development to be merged into the <span style=\"color:green\">master</span>. To do this we must first move to the <span style=\"color:green\">master</span> branch and then merge the changes from development:\n",

    "    git checkout master\n",
    "    git merge development\n",
