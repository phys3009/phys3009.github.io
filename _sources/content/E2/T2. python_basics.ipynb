There are also subtle differences which go beyond syntax which it can be helpful to grasp.\n",

This only works if it is obvious how the number should be converted. Otherwise python throws an error. All non-zero numbers go to `True`. `0` and `None` become `False` but we can't convert a string to a number if it doesn't look like a number (int('1') works but int('one') doesn't). \n"
