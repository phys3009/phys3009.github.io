They enable you to completely isolate the particular versions of python and installed packages so that they do not influence or conflict with work for other projects.\n",

    "#### 1.4.1.1 Creating a new environment\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 options for creating your own environment. We can either:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. create an empty environment called myproject\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda\n",
    "    conda create -n \"myproject\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. create an environment called myenv specifying the version of python and some packages we would like installed\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda\n",
    "    conda create -n \"myenv\" python=3.10 numpy matplotlib pandas=1.5.3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. use a special setup file called environment.yml which is in the current working directory which specifies all the details of what we want in the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can do this we need our terminal to be in the same directory as the file environment.yml. Currently my command prompt is in my user directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/images/cmd_prompt.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width:350px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "I can find the file path by right clicking on the files inside vscode and selecting \"reveal in file explorer\". Then copy the filepath.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/images/path.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width:300px;\"/>\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/images/filepath.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width:600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally in the terminal type `cd \"path\\to\\file\"` which you just copied and the command prompt will indicate that you have moved to a different directory which contains the files you can see in vscode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can create the environment from the file environment.yml:\n",
    "    \n",
    "```conda\n",
    "    conda env create -f environment.yml \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4.1.2 Activating an environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have created an environment we must activate it\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda\n",
    "    conda activate myproject\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/images/myproject_conda.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This needs to be done when you open the prompt each time. People often forget and then end up installing things in `(base)` rather than the correct environment. Double check. If you see your environment in brackets at the start of the prompt you've done it correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see what environments are available and have previously been setup on a system\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda\n",
    "    conda env list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4.1.3 Is this all this necessary? \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have (at least) two projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. myproject uses python 3.10 because scipy 1.35 requires certain dependencies that don't exist in python 3.11. It also uses scikit-optimise which uses numpy. The latest version of numpy has deprecated (got rid of) np.int in favour of np.int64 and therefore you have to use an older version of numpy.\n",
    "2. mysecondproject uses python 3.11 and the latest numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a trivial example. With virtual environments you can configure two environments setup the correct way and all you do is activate the correct virtual environment to work on each project. If you don't do this you'd have to keep installing and uninstalling different versions of packages. People who use your code would also need to keep changing, and it all ends up in a horrible mess! This is particularly true if you use smaller packages (ie not just numpy, matplotlib etc). To make things easy I often name my virtual environments with a name related to the project I'm working on, to help identify which environment should be used for each project.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to switch environments either activate a different environment or deactivate the current one to return to base\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda\n",
    "    conda deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4.2 Package management\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have **activated your environment** you can see which packages are installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda\n",
    "    conda list\n",
    "```\n",
    "you can then install additional packages (N.B pkgname is a placeholder for the name of the package you want to install):\n",

    "    conda install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "install particular version\n",
    "```\n",
    "    conda install matplotlib=3.5.2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to conda there is another package manager called pip. This can also be used to install packages into conda environments. It is generally recommended to try conda first and then if that fails try pip like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda\n",
    "    pip install pkgname\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to uninstall either conda or pip packages you can simply type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    conda uninstall pkgname\n",
    "    pip uninstall pkgname\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to export the contents of your environment (perhaps so that someone else can set up theirs in an identical way)\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda\n",
    "    conda env export --no-builds > environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "The additional option (--no-builds) is not necessary but help to make sure that the file when exported will work on other machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now delete the environment (it's important to do this before setting up the new one on the same computer. Normally you would use this file to setup the enviroment on a different computer but trying to setup on the same computer if the environment already exists creates a conflict).\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda\n",
    "    conda env remove -n myproject\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

Open this in the editor and look at the contents. Python makes importing so easy. A `package` is a folder containing python files. Individual .py files are `modules`.
