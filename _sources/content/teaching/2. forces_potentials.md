## Relationship between force and potential

The force, $F$, on an object can be related to the gradient in its
potential energy, $U$, with respect to distance, $x$, by the formula

$$
    F=-\frac{dU}{dx} \tag{2.1}
$$

This is an extremely important formula in physics and we will use it a
lot in this module.

### The sign of the potential energy

When the potential energy is negative the interaction between two bodies is attractive. For example, consider the potential energy of a system of positive and negative charges.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/2_1.png" alt="potential U < 0" width="150" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 2.1 - When the potential energy is negative the interaction between two bodies is favourable. Consider the example of the potential energy of a system of positive and negative charges.</em></p>
</div>

Similarly, when the potential energy is positive, interactions are unfavourable.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/2_2.png" alt="potential U > 0" width="150" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 2.2 - When the potential energy is positive the interaction between two bodies is unfavourable. Consider the example of the potential energy of a system of two positive charges.</em></p>
</div>

### The sign of the force

Similar rules and the same sign convention apply to forces.

## Strong Inter-atomic and intermolecular forces

### Electrostatic (Coulomb) Interactions

You will have already met Coulomb interactions in the first year 'Newton to
Einstein' module. Some atoms and molecules (for example proteins) may acquire a net charge
and will interact via electrostatic forces:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/2_5.png" alt="Proteins" width="300" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 2.5 - Protein molecules such as Insulin (pictured here) become
charged when placed in aqueous environments. The charge that they
acquire is sensitive to pH and salt concentrations. These molecules can
interact via electrostatic forces</em></p>
</div>


The **electrostatic potential energy, U,** of two molecules having charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ that are separated by a
distance, $x$, is given by:

$$
U = \frac{q_1q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon\varepsilon_0x} \tag{2.2}
$$

where $\varepsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} Fm^{-1}$ is the permittivity of free space. $\epsilon$ is the relative permittivity of medium in which the molecules are suspended and has values ranging from $1$ (vacuum) to $80$ (water).

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/2_6.png" alt="Coulomb force" width="150" height=auto>
</div>

Differentiating this expression with respect to the distance, $x$, and using equation 2.1 we find that the **electrostatic force acting between** two molecules having charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ that are separated by a distance, $x$, is given by:

$$
F = \frac{q_1q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon\varepsilon_0x^2} \tag{2.3}
$$

The sign of the force therefore depends upon the signs of the charges

If $q_{1}q_{2} < 0$ **force is attractive** (negative sign)

If $q_{1}q_{2} > 0$ **force is repulsive** (positive sign)

### The range of interactions

As discussed previously, the thermal motion of atoms and molecules tends
to disrupt the interactions between them.

- At *small* distances interactions between atoms and molecules are strong enough to overcome the effects of thermal motion.

- At *large* distances interactions between atoms and molecules become weaker and are unable to overcome the effects of thermal motion.

*Small* and *large* are relative terms and depend on the nature and strength of the interaction between two atoms/molecules. We can estimate the range of an interaction by comparing the thermal energy to the size (magnitude) of the potential energy of two molecules:

- If $|U(x)| ≤ kT$ thermal motion disrupts the interactions

- If $|U(x)| > kT$ the atoms/molecules still feel the interactions between them

**When the two are equal we see a cross over from one regime to another. The distance, $x$, at which this occurs gives a measure of the range of an interaction.**

### Example: Range of electrostatic interactions

We can obtain an estimate of the range $X_{range}$ of the electrostatic interaction between two charged atoms/molecules if we equate $k_{B}T$ with our expression for the electrostatic potential energy (equation 2.2)

$$
|U(X)| = \frac{q_1q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon\varepsilon_0X} = k_{B}T \tag{2.5}
$$

rearanging for $x$ gives

$$
X_{range} = \frac{q_1q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon\varepsilon_0k_{B}T} \tag{2.6}
$$

- $x ≥ X_{range}$ electrostatic interactions become unimportant relative
to thermal energies

- $x < X_{range}$ electrostatic interactions start to dominate interactions between atoms/molecules

### Ionic Crystals

Electrostatic interactions are responsible for the formation of ionic crystals. For example, consider NaCl which consists of equal numbers of positive $Na^{+}$ and negative $Cl^{-}$ ions arranged in a regular lattice.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/2_7.png" alt="NaCl crystal" width="200" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 2.7 - Electrostatic interactions are responsible
for the formation of ionic crystals. Large green ions are Chloride. Small red ions are Sodium
</em></p>
</div>

Each $Cl^{-}$ ion has 6 nearest neighbour $Na^{+}$ ions at a distance $r$; 12 next-nearest neighbour $Cl^{-}$ ions at $\sqrt(2)r$ and 8 next-next-nearest neighbour $Na^{+}$ ions at $\sqrt(3)r$. We can use this information to calculate the (cohesive) energy per ion holding the crystal together by summing up the contributions to the potential energy from all neighbours to give:

$$
U_{coh} = - \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon\varepsilon_{0}r}\left( \frac{6}{1} - \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{8}{\sqrt{3}} - \ldots \right) = - \frac{\alpha e^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon\varepsilon_{0}r} \tag{2.7}
$$

Where $\alpha$ is called the Madelung constant (*α*=1.748 for NaCl) and $e$ is the electronic charge $1.6 \times 10^{-19}C$

### Covalent Bonds

Covalent bonds are highly directional and are chemical in origin (e.g. pi bond created by overlap of d electron orbitals). These interactions originate from the sharing of **valence** electrons to facilitate the filling of electronic shells within atoms stable structures.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/2_8.png" alt="Covalent bond" width="280" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 2.8 - Covalent bond between two Chlorine atoms formed by "sharing" of and electron pair.
</em></p>
</div>

-   Covalent forces (bonds) operate over short distances 0.1-0.2 nm

-   The energies associated with the formation of these bonds are
    typically 2 to 8 eV

You will learn more about these in the 3rd year Solid State module.

### Metallic bonding

Sharing of electrons between metal atoms gives rise to another form of
bonding. However, in metallic bonds, the electrons become delocalised
throughout the material in such a way that they are shared between many
nuclei .

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/2_9.png" alt="Metallic bond" width="200" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 2.9 - Metallic bonding in a metal. The delocalised electrons are shared between many nuclei.
    </em></p>
</div>

The 'sea' of delocalised electrons helps to screen the repulsion between
neighbouring nuclei and hold them together.

-   Metallic bonds are comparable in strength to covalent bonds (a few
    $eV$ per bond or $\sim 100k_{B}T$)

The delocalisation of electrons can be used to explain many of the
properties of metals:

- **Optical** : The optical properties of metals are determined by how
the 'sea' of electrons responds to the oscillating electric and magnetic
fields associated with incident light

- **Electrical and Thermal** : Delocalised electrons are easier to move,
so metals are good conductors of heat and electricity

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/2_10.png" alt="Nanoparticles" width="300" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 2.10 - Gold nanoparticles can be formed from very small nm size pieces of gold or silver. The optical properties of these nanoparticles are determined by the motion of the electrons over the surface of the particles.
</em></p>
</div>

The bulk properties of gold are determined by how its electrons move
around. When we make gold nanoparticles the motion of the electrons
becomes confined and the properties change. In the gold nanoparticle
solutions shown, the optical properties (colour) are changed by changing
the size of the particles.

### What do we mean by a "Strong Interaction"?

**Strong** and **Weak** are relative terms. In the context of interactions
we can think of a **Strong** bond as something which is stable against
thermal fluctuations. That is in a large sample, even if we wait a long
time, none of the bonds will be disrupted. In contrast a **Weak**
interaction is one which has a reasonable probability of
being disrupted. The two atoms / molecules being held together
by the interaction would then be free to diffuse away from one another.

To define this probability more carefully we return to the Boltzmann
probability:

$$
P(x) \propto \exp^{- U/k_{B}T}  \tag{2.8}
$$

The probability of a bond / interaction being disrupted by thermal fluctuations is *proportional* to the potential of the interaction divided by $k_{B}T$ (N.B it is proportional because the prefactor in front of the exponential is unknown -- related to collision probabilities etc). The stronger the interaction the larger the value of $U/k_{B}T$. To illustrate, a covalent bond $\sim 100k_{B}T$ whereas a Van der Waal's interaction (to be covered in later lectures) $\sim 2k_{B}T$.

$$
U/k_{B}T \sim 100 \rightarrow e^{-100} = 3.7 \times 10^{-44} 
$$

Since the probability is going to be really small this is a stable or "strong" interaction

$$
U/k_{B}T \sim 2 \rightarrow e^{-2} = 0.13
$$

Since the probability is reasonable that a thermal fluctuation will break this bond the interaction is described as "weak".
