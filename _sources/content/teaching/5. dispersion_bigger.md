## 5. Dispersion Interactions -- larger objects

### Gecko feet

The additive nature of interactions is expected to effect the strength
of the dispersion interaction between macroscopic bodies.

Geckos live in hot dusty climates. These creatures have the extraordinary ability that they can climb sheer
surfaces and walk upside down across smooth glass plates. The mechanism by which they do this depends on small soft structures on their feet which allow them to stick to almost any surface. These small structures deform when the gecko puts its foot on a surface. This increases the amount of contact between the foot and the surface and thus increases the effective strength of the dispersion interactions between the gecko and the thing it is standing on. As a result they can walk up walls and across ceilings.

### Dispersion interactions between macroscopic bodies

We have seen that the additive nature of short-range dispersion interactions can make these interactions significant, but how can we describe these interactions mathematically? We will begin by considering the interaction between an isolated
atom/molecule and a semi-infinite solid surface separated by a distance D.

<div style="text-align: center;">

    <p><em>Figure 5.1 - Schematic of a point atom at a distance D from a semi-infinite plane.</em></p>
</div>

Consider a small annulus or ring in the solid surface which has a radius, y, and which is a distance, x, from the atom/molecule:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="media/5_3.jpg" alt="semi-infinite plane" width="350" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 5.2 - Splitting the plane up into elemental volumes. All the points a distance r from the atom form a circle with radius y.</em></p>
</div>

All the elemental volumes in this ring are at the same distance r from the isolated atom, they therefore have the same interaction. Integrating over x and y we can add up all the contributions in the slab (see lectures for details).

**Interactions between a slab of material and another semi-infinite slab.**

Derive an expression for the dispersion forces acting between a perfectly flat slab of area S and a semi-infinite solid if the number density of atoms in the slab and solid are n~1~ and n~2~ respectively.

    <p><em>Figure 5.3 - The interaction between a slab and the plane.</em></p>
</div>

To solve this problem we start with the expression for the potential energy due to dispersion interactions between a molecule and
semi-infinite surface which are separated by a distance x. 

$$U(D) = \mathbf{-}\frac{\pi nC}{{6x}^{3}}$$

We then work out the number of atoms in a slice (red in the diagram above). We add up all the contributions to the dispersion interaction between this slice and the semi-infinite surface. Finally, we add up all the slices in the slab to reach the total interaction with the solid surface.

### Interactions between a sphere and a semi-infinite slab

Derive an expression for the dispersion forces which act between a sphere of radius R (for separations $D \>\>R$) and a semi-infinite solid if the number density of atoms in the slab and sphere are $n_{1} and $n_{2}$ respectively.

As in the last example, we start with the expression for the potential energy due to dispersion interactions between an individual
atom/molecule and a flat surface and add up the contributions due to all the atoms/molecules in the sphere.

### A general strategy

In all the examples above we follow a similar pattern

1.  Look for the symmetries in the system. Eg. With the sphere it is
    symmetric about the middle.

2.  Split the problem up into elemental volumes (that is those atoms
    that are all the same distance from the semi-infinite sheet).

3.  Integrate between the limits to add up the different contributions

### The Hamaker Constant

The strength of the dispersion interaction between materials is often quantified in terms of the Hamaker constant, *A*

$$A_{12} = n_{1}n_{2}\pi^{2}C$$

*$n_{1}* and *$n_{2}$* are the number densities of atoms/molecules in the two interacting materials (*$m^{-3}*)

C is the 'strength' of the interaction between an atom/molecule from one
material and an atom/molecule from the other ($Jm^{6}$)

$A_{12}$ is the Hamaker constant for materials 1 and 2 (J). We can rewrite our expressions for the dispersion interaction energy
between two macroscopic bodies in terms of the Hamaker constant:

- Dispersion Interaction energy between a flat slab of area, *S*, and a semi-infinite solid:

$$U(D) = \mathbf{-}\frac{n_{1}n_{2}\pi CS}{12D^{2}}\mathbf{= -}\frac{A_{12}S}{12\pi D^{2}}$$

- Dispersion Interaction energy between a sphere of radius, *R,* and a
semi-infinite solid:

$$U(D) = \mathbf{-}\frac{n_{1}n_{2}\pi^{2}CR}{3D}\mathbf{= -}\frac{A_{12}R}{3D}$$

We can also write the forces in terms of the Hamaker constant:

- Dispersion force between a flat slab of area, *S*, and a semi-infinite solid:

$$F(D) = \mathbf{-}\frac{dU}{dD}\mathbf{= -}\frac{A_{12}S}{6\pi D^{3}}$$

- Dispersion force between a sphere of radius, *R,* and a semi-infinite solid

$$F(D) = \mathbf{-}\frac{dU}{dD}\mathbf{= -}\frac{A_{12}R}{3D^{2}}$$

Hence we can determine the strength of the dispersion interaction $A_{12} between two materials by measuring forces acting between two macroscopic bodies. The importance of a Hamaker constant is that we combine a bunch of constants into a single one which represents how two materials interact.

### Some other important geometries

The geometry of the macroscopic bodies is important in determining the separation dependence of the dispersion interaction.

$$U(D) = \mathbf{-}\frac{A_{12}}{3D}\frac{R_{1}R_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}}$$

- Parallel cylinders

</div>

$$U(D) = \mathbf{-}\frac{A_{12}L}{12\sqrt{2}D^{3/2}}\left( \frac{R_{1}R_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}} \right)^{\mathbf{1/2}}$$

- Perpendicular cylinders

    <p><em>Figure 5.6 - Perpendicular cylinders</em></p>
</div>

$$U(D) = \mathbf{-}\frac{A_{12}}{6D}\sqrt{R_{1}R_{2}}$$

### How big are Hamaker constants?

Values of *A* typically lie in the range $10^{-21}$ to $10^{-19}$ Joules
($k_{B}T$ at room temperature $\sim 4.41 \times 10^{-21}J$)

### The range of dispersion interactions between macroscopic bodies 

We can calculate the range of the interaction by comparing dispersion and thermal energies i.e. $|U(D_{range})| \sim k_{B}T$. In reality, this description does not work for truly macroscopic objects, but is valid on the submicron and nanometre length scales where thermal effects are still important in influencing the behaviour of particles and inter-surface forces.

For the interaction between a sphere of radius R and a solid surface we have:

$$\left| U(D) \right| = \frac{A_{12}R}{3D_{range}}\mathbf{\approx}kT$$

Hence

$$D_{range} \approx \frac{A_{12}R}{3kT}$$

For values of T=300K, R=10 nm and $A_{12}=10^{-19}J$, $D_{range} \sim 10R = 100 nm$. This is significantly longer range than the interaction between individual atoms/molecules ($\sim 0.3nm$). The potential for extended bodies depends on a much lower power of R usually $1/R^{2} or $1/R^{3}$ depending on geometry, whereas for individual molecules it is $1/R^{6}$. This is why dispersion forces are so important because in material bodies when we add up the individual interactions we find the range over which they are not disrupted by thermal interactions is much longer.

### The magnitude of forces between macroscopic bodies

We can also calculate the magnitude of the forces exerted on macroscopic bodies due to dispersion forces. Sticking with the sphere and surface we have:

$$F(D) = \mathbf{-}\frac{dU}{dD}\mathbf{= -}\frac{A_{12}R}{3D^{2}}$$

If a nanoparticle has $R=10nm$, $A_{12}=10^{-19}J$ and $D=100nm$, $F \sim 0.03pN$. If $D=10nm$, $F \sim 3pN$. These are very small forces but they can be measured.

We can also calculate the force between a perfectly flat slab and a
semi-infinite solid. Recall that the force is given by

$$F(D) = \mathbf{-}\frac{A_{12}S}{6\pi D^{3}}$$

If the area of the slab is $S=10^{-4}m^{2} (1cm^{2}) and $A_{12}=10^{-19}J$. What is the force between the slab and the surface at a separation of 0.3 nm? The answer is ~20,000 Newtons, This is a very large force!

### Summary of key concepts

Dispersion interactions arise due to instantaneous dipole fluctuations and the dipoles these induce in neighbouring atoms/molecules

The potential energy due to attractive dispersion interactions between atoms and molecules has the form:

$$U(x) = - \frac{\alpha(qd)^{2}}{\left( 2\pi\varepsilon\varepsilon_{0} \right)^{2}}\frac{1}{x^{6}}\mathbf{= -}\frac{C}{x^{6}}$$

Range of dispersion forces between individual atoms is ~ 0.3 nm.

The total interaction (dispersion + hard sphere repulsion) between neutral atoms and molecules can be described using a '6-12'
Lennard-Jones potential of the form:

$$U(x) = 4\gamma\left\lbrack \left( \frac{\sigma}{x} \right)^{12} - \left( \frac{\sigma}{x} \right)^{6} \right\rbrack$$

Dispersion interactions between macroscopic bodies occur over significantly longer ranges than for isolated atoms/molecules.
We can derive expressions for the dispersion interaction energy and forces between macroscopic objects.

**Dispersion Interaction energy between a flat slab of area, *S*, and a

Dispersion forces on nanoscale objects can be on the pN to nN scales
