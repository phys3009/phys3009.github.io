When lipid bi-layers are formed in solution, there is an excess energy
associated with the exposed hydrophobic tail groups at the edges of the
structure.

</div>

The bi-layers can offset this energy by folding around to close themselves off and form an isolated shell or vesicle.Vesicles are closed structures that can be used to encapsulate materials in their interior for use in drug delivery. If the outside of the
vesicle is decorated with specific chemical receptors which cause the vesicle to rupture and deliver its cargo when it reaches its target, it can act like a _magic bullet_.

</div>

Vesicles are also the most basic model for understanding the physics of the cell wall. A cell membrane
consists of a vesicle with additional molecules such as membrane proteins distributed in the lipid bi-layer (A lipid is a type of amphiphile).

## Bi-layer / membrane elasticity

Earlier we considered the optimum headgroup area $a_{0}$ which is at the
minimum of the free energy. However, when a bi-layer is bent the
amphiphiles on the outside of the bi-layer move slightly further apart,
whilst the molecules on the inside are pushed closer together. Both
these changes will increase the free energy of the bilayer leading to a
resistive force or elasticity.

</div>

In the simplest approximation:

$$\mathrm{\Delta}U\  \approx \ \frac{1}{2}k\mathrm{\Delta}a^{2}$$

**Calculation: Estimating the elasticity of a membrane**

1.  Calculate the head group area at the middle and outside edge of the
    curved membrane:

    a. $a_{0} = R\theta Z$

    b. $a_{0} + \mathrm{\Delta}a$=$\left( R + \frac{d}{2} \right)\theta Z$

2.  Solve to find $\mathrm{\Delta}a = \frac{da_{0}}{2R}$

3.  The number of headgroups per unit area is $\frac{2}{a_0}$. One on outer edge,
    one inner edge so the energy per unit area is $\frac{1}{2}k{\Delta}a^{2}\frac{2}{a_{0}}$. Substituting Î”a gives:

$$\frac{\mathrm{\Delta}U}{A}  \approx \ \frac{ka_{0}d^{2}}{4R^{2}}$$

replacing d with the critical chain length $l_{c}$ and defining $\kappa = 2 kl_{c}^{2}a_{0}$ we find:

$$\frac{\mathrm{\Delta}U}{A}\  \approx \ \frac{\kappa}{2R^{2}}$$

This implies that a membrane has an elasticity with spring constant $\kappa$.
It also shows that a membrane gets increasingly stiff if the constituent
amphiphiles are long and or fat.

## Membrane (Entropic Repulsion)

The stiffness or bending modulus of a typical membrane is sufficiently
small that they may undergo thermal induced fluctuations. Below we
compare a membrane with some other typical "soft" materials.

    <p><em>Figure 17.5 - Moduli of common materials</em></p>
</div>

The closer two membranes come together the more these "thermal undulations" become restricted by the presence of
the other membrane. In comparison with the lecture on steric interactions we may be able to guess that as the number of
configurations (or undulations) is reduced the entropy of the system increases. Since this is unfavourable we expect a repulsive entropic force between the membranes.

**Calculation: What is the force experienced by 2 membranes?**

To make this calculation tractable we have to make a number of
simplifications. These it turns out affect the final prefactor but give
rise to the correct physics.

We start with the following assumptions:

1.  2 bi-layers a distance $D$ apart will interact when the modes have
    amplitude $\frac{D}{2}$

2.  From the equipartition principle each mode has $\frac{k_{B}T}{2}$ energy
    associated with it.

3.  Each mode is a 2D wave and occupies an area $x^{2}$

Comes from geometry. Write $x$ in terms of $R$ and $D$

$$x^{2} {\approx} RD$$

$$Pressure = \ \frac{{\mathrm{\Delta}U}_{mode}}{{Vol}_{mode}} = \ \frac{k_{B}T}{\pi x^{2}D}= $\frac{k_{B}T}{\pi RD^{2}}$$

4.  Use earlier result to find an alternative expression for $R$. ${\Delta}U = \frac{k_{B}T}{2}$ and $A = {\pi}x^{2}$

$$\frac{\mathrm{\Delta}U}{A} \approx \ \frac{\kappa}{2R^{2}}$$

$$\frac{1}{R} \approx \frac{{(k_{B}T)}^{2}}{\kappa\pi D}$$

The final result is:

$$P = \frac{{(k_{B}T)}^{2}}{\kappa\pi^{2}D^{3}}$$

This pressure is always repulsive and is stronger for more flexible
membranes. The pressure also varies as $1/D^{3}$. This is interesting since
this is the same dependence we observed for the Van der Waals
interaction between two surfaces but with the opposite sign. The
combined pressure would therefore be:

$$P_{Tot} = \left[ \frac{\left( k_{B}T \right)^{2}}{{\kappa}{\pi}^{2}} - \frac{A}{6\pi} \right]frac{1}{D^{3}}$$

This has an interesting consequence that the pressure for a membrane is
either always positive or always negative regardless of distance $D$,
depending on the sign of the bracket. Compare this with the DLVO
potential for a charged colloid in a solution of ions which has the
electrostatic (osmotic) and VdWs terms which exhibits a maximum, meaning
that at small separations the particles become stuck together, whereas
at large separations the pressure is repulsive.
