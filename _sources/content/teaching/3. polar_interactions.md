## Polar Molecules

Many molecules are electrically neutral and carry no net charge.
However, they can still possess an **electric dipole moment**. Consider the molecule **HCl** (hydrogen chloride), although it is
electrically neutral, the electrons in the $HCl$ bond lie closer to the chlorine nucleus, giving the $Cl$ end of the molecule a  slightly negative charge and the H end of the molecule a slightly positive charge of the same magnitude. The reason for this is that **electronegative atoms** such as chlorine have a higher affinity for electrons than atoms such as hydrogen. In the case of HCl, the electrons are pulled towards the chlorine atom giving rise to a **permanent dipole.**

### Zwitterions and dipolar ions

In some cases, the polar properties of the molecules depend upon the local environment (e.g. presence of solvents).
Water soluble dipolar molecules of this type are called **Zwitterions** (Zwitter- German meaning 'hybrid' ). Some molecules contain both a net charge and a dipole moment. These molecules are referred to as **dipolar ions**.

### How do we define an electric dipole moment?

Recall from electromagnetism that a dipole consists of two charges ($+q$ and $-q$) separated by a distance $d$. The dipole moment, $p$ is then defined as:

$$\mathbf{p} = qd\ \widehat{\mathbf{r}}$$

The electric dipole moment has units of $Cm$.

## Electric Field due to a dipole

When calculating the forces that are exerted during dipole-dipole
interactions it is first necessary to calculate the field due to an
electric dipole. Consider two charges separated by a small distance, $d$ in a medium of
dielectric constant, $\epsilon$

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/3_4.png" alt="dipole field" width="350" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 3.4 - Calculating the dipole field from two point charges at a distance x</em></p>
</div>

We can calculate the field at the point, $x$, by summing up the fields
due to the two point charges. When $x >> d$ this gives the result (for
an axial position)

$$\mathbf{E} = \frac{qd}{2\pi\varepsilon\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{1}{x^{3}}\mathbf{i}$$

## Potential energy of a dipole in an electric field

Consider a dipole in an external electric field. There is no net force on the dipole as the forces on each of the charges are equal and opposite. However, the forces exerted on these charges will create a torque on the dipole causing it to rotate. We can calculate the potential energy ($U$) of the dipole by calculating the work done ($W$) in rotating the dipole, as $U=-W$.

    <p><em>Figure 3.5 - Energy due to rotating a dipole in an external uniform electric field</em></p>
</div>

This gives the result:

$$U_{dipole} = - \mathbf{p}.\mathbf{E}$$

## Polarisation of atoms and molecules using external fields

When an electric field is applied to a neutral atom or
molecule, the forces on the charged particles (electrons and nuclei)
which comprise the atom or molecule cause some charge separation and
hence lead to the formation of an **induced dipole** on the
atom/molecule. **The dipole moment of an atom or molecule can be related to the
external applied electric field by**:

$$\mathbf{p} = \alpha\mathbf{E}_{ext}$$

where *$\alpha$* is the **polarisability** of the atom/molecule in units $C^{2}m^{2}J^{-1}$.

### Polarisability of atoms, molecules and small particles 

We can determine the polarisability of an atom, molecule or small
particle in an applied external field by balancing the electrostatic
forces between the separated charges and the force exerted due to the
application external field. This gives the result:

$$\alpha = 4\pi\varepsilon_{0}d^{3}$$

Where $d$ is typically smaller than, but comparable to radius, $R$, of the
atom, molecule or particle. So $\alpha$ scales with the volume, $V$, of the
atom/molecule ($\alpha \sim R^{3} \sim V$).

**Polarisability scales with the volume of the molecule.**
