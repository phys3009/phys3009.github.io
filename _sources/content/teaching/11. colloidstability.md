## Colloids and nanoparticles

Colloids are mixtures where small particles (\<1 μm in diameter) of one
substance are suspended in a second medium or continuous phase.
They can be made of solid particles suspended in a liquid or liquid
droplets suspended in another liquid (also called emulsions). **They are not solutions!** The material is not completely dispersed, but exists as discrete particles.

Colloidal interactions govern the properties of nanoscale particles and
interactions between surfaces in liquid environments. Understanding and
controlling these interactions is therefore essential in the manufacture
of nanoparticles, ferrofluids (magnetic nanoparticles) and solution
based quantum dots. These interactions are also important in mediating
the interactions between large biological molecules such as proteins and
play important role in stabilising the nano to micron scale fat droplets
in milk.

The key challenge in manufacturing nanoparticles and colloidal
dispersions is preventing the interparticle/intersurface forces from
causing the small particles from sticking together. Moreover, these
systems have a very high surface to volume ratio when compared to bulk
materials. This means that there is a large energy penalty associated
with the large surface area of these dispersed systems.

The natural tendency is for small particles to stick together or
_flocculate_ to form an aggregate (more on aggregation in a later
lecture) and hence reduce their total surface area. We have already seen
that dispersion forces result in a mutual attraction between particles.
These can drive the flocculation of even very dilute systems.

## How do we stop things sticking together?

We need to introduce a short-range repulsion force to keep particles apart and prevent them flocculating under the action of dispersion forces. In water, this is often done by
decorating the surface of the particles with charged groups and adding a
small amount of salt.

</div>

When the particles are added to salt water (or electrolyte) the dissociated salt ions cluster around the charged particles to form a counterion cloud. The counterion cloud can be thought of as having two regions. The first is the Stern (also sometimes referred to as the Helmholtz) layer. This layer consists of ions that carry the opposite charge to the surface groups on the particle surfaces and is usually tightly bound to the surface. The
second layer is called the diffuse double layer. This layer consists of a mixture of positive and negative counterions which are relatively mobile and are distributed in such a way that the system becomes charge neutral.

    <p><em>Figure 11.2 - Schematic showing how charged ions in the water form next to a charged surface.</em></p>
</div>

If the particles are charge neutral then there can be no net electrostatic interaction between them. So how does decorating the surface of particles with charged groups introduce a repulsive force between them? The answer to this question is that the presence of the counterions around the particles creates an osmotic pressure between the particle surfaces.

**Osmotic Pressure --** the pressure arising from spatial gradients in
the concentration of a solute. This pressure acts to restore a uniform
concentration and will cause a flow of water.

You can see this effect very nicely in this video which I showed in the lecture. Concentrated sugar solution in a permeable membrane bag (water can pass through but the sugar cannot). The osmotic pressure causes water to flow into the bag to reduce the concentration difference

When the particles/surfaces approach **the local concentration of
counterions between them increases relative to the bulk concentration of
counterions (i.e. far away from the particles)**.

If we think of the charge neutral system of ions floating around in
between the two particle surfaces as a non interacting (ideal) gas of
ions we can use the ideal gas law to derive an expression for the
pressure exerted by the counterion clouds. However, before we proceed it
is worth mentioning that although the electrostatic potential energy of
the charged particles does not influence their interactions directly in
an electrolyte, it does determine how the counterions will be
distributed around each particle. As we will show below, this has some
influence on the local concentration of counterions and hence the
osmotic pressure exerted between the particle surfaces.

The osmotic pressure, $\Pi$, which pushes the surfaces apart and tries to
restore a uniform counterion concentration is given by

$$\Pi = \left( n_{+} + n_{-} - 2n_{0} \right)k_{B}T$$

where $n_{+}$ and $n_{-}$ are number densities of positive and negative
ions in the gap, and $n_{0}$ is their concentration far away from the
surfaces. Note that for an electrolyte (salt) in bulk solution (e.g.
NaCl) the concentration of positive counterions ($Na^{+}$) is equal to that
of the negative counterions ($Cl^{-}$).

### How do we calculate $n^{+}$ and $n^{-}$?

We have deliberately assumed that the number densities/concentrations of
positive and negative counterions in the gap between the two surfaces
will be different. This is not unreasonable if we consider our diagram
of the stern and diffuse double layers above, as we might expect an
imbalance in these concentrations to occur for charge neutrality to be
maintained.

To determine the number densities of the counterions we need to consider
the electrostatic potential energy of the counterions in solution and
how this influences their local concentration.

For an ion of charge $\pm ze$, sitting in a spatially varying electrostatic
potential $V(x)$, the energy, $E$, is simply given by

$$E = \pm zeV(x)$$

To determine how this energy influences the distribution of counterions,
we recall that the probability, $p$, of a particle occupying a given
energy state can be described by Boltzmann statistics (See thermal
physics notes)

$$p_{\pm} = p_{0}\exp\left( - \frac{E_{\pm}}{k_{B}T} \right)$$

In this case, the energy of the particle is determined by its position
in the potential $V(x)$ (as described above) and the local number density
must scale with the probability associated with finding the particle
with a given energy. Hence we can simply write the number densities of
positive and negative counterions as:

$$n_{\pm} = n_{0}\exp\left( - \frac{E_{\pm}}{k_{B}T} \right) = n_{0}\exp\left( \pm \frac{zeV(x)}{k_{B}T} \right)$$

Hence, our expression for the osmotic pressure becomes:

$$\Pi = \left( n_{+} + n_{-} - 2n_{0} \right)k_{B}T = {2n}_{0}k_{B}T\left( \cosh\left( \frac{zeV(x)}{k_{B}T} \right) - 1 \right)$$

In the limit of small surface potentials i.e. when $\left( \frac{zeV(x)}{k_{B}T} \right) << 1$, this reduces to:

$$\Pi = n_{0}\frac{z^{2}e^{2}}{k_{B}T}\left( V(x) \right)^{2}$$

So if we know how $V(x)$ depends on the distance away from the surface we
can calculate the osmotic pressure due to the counterions.

### What form of V(x) should we use?

The true form of the electrical potential between colloids and charged
surfaces is complicated. However, a good starting point is to
approximate $V(x)$ to the form expected for the potential due to an
isolated charged surface in an electrolyte.

To obtain this we must first solve the **Poisson equation** which
relates the electrostatic potential $V(x)$ to the local charge density,
$\rho$, using the following formula.

$$\ \ \frac{- d^{2}V}{dx^{2}} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon\varepsilon_{0}}\ \ $$

where $\epsilon$ and ${\epsilon}_{0}$, are the relative permittivity of the medium in which
the counterions are dissolved (usually water) and permittivity of free
space ($Fm^{-1}$) respectively.

</div>

### Potential near a planar/flat charged surface

The charge density associated with the counterions is simply the product
of their charge and number densities;

In the limit of small potentials, , the Poisson equation for the cloud
of counterions becomes

$$\frac{d^{2}V}{dx^{2}} = \frac{2z^{2}e^{2}n_{0}}{\varepsilon\varepsilon_{0}k_{B}T}V(x)$$

### Solution of the Poisson equation and the Debye screening length

The Poisson equation for the counterion cloud is very similar to the
equation for simple harmonic motion ($a=-{\omega}^{2}x$) and therefore must have a
solution which consists of a sum of positive and negative exponentials.
However, we require that the potential decays to zero for infinite, x.
(If it didn't, the total energy of the counterion cloud would be
infinite!). This means that we are left with a solution which consists
of a simple negative exponential of the form

$$V(x) = V_{0}\exp( - \kappa x)$$

Where $V_{0}$ is the surface potential (i.e. the electrostatic potential at
the surface) and $\kappa$ is a decay constant such that if we insert $V(x)$ into
the Poisson equation we obtain:

$$\frac{1}{\kappa} = \left( \frac{\varepsilon\varepsilon_{0}k_{B}T}{2{n_{0}z}^{2}e^{2}} \right)^{1/2}$$

$1/{\kappa}$ is the Debye screening length. **(N.B the Debye length is $1/{\kappa}$ not
${\kappa}$)**

It is the distance over which electrostatic interactions are screened in
an electrolyte and $V_{0}$ is the potential at the surface.

### Osmotic pressure between surfaces (revisited)

Recall that the osmotic pressure due to counterions between charged surface has the form:

$$\Pi = n_{0}\frac{z^{2}e^{2}}{k_{B}T}\left( V(x) \right)^{2}$$

where:

$$V(x) = V_{0}\exp( - \kappa x)$$

If we insert our solution for the potential we obtain:

$$\Pi = {4n}_{0}\frac{z^{2}e^{2}V_{0}^{2}}{k_{B}T}\exp( - \kappa D)$$

where $D=2x$ is the distance between the two surfaces.

**This expression describes the positive (repulsive) osmotic pressure
caused by the condensation of counterions in the gap between two
surfaces.**

### Total pressure between surfaces

The total pressure between two charged surfaces in an electrolyte is
given by summing the contributions due to repulsive osmotic pressure and
attractive dispersion forces to give

$$P_{tot} = \Pi + P_{dispersion}$$

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/11_5.png" alt="Pressure between surfaces" width="250" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 11.5 - Pressure between two charged surfaces</em></p>
</div>

where $P\_{dispersion} is the pressure due to the attractive dispersion
interactions. We have:

$$P_{tot} = {4n}_{0}\frac{z^{2}e^{2}V_{0}^{2}}{k_{B}T}{\exp( - \kappa D)}^{} - \frac{A}{6\pi D^{3}}$$

where the first term is due to the osmotic pressure and the second due
to the attractive dispersion forces. This is a simplified form of the equations derived by Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, Overbeek (DLVO) when formulating the DLVO theory of colloidal
stability.

The plot below shows how the dispersion pressure, the osmotic (double
layer/counterion) pressure and total pressure vary with the separation
of the surfaces.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/11_6.png" alt="DLVO potential" width="350" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 11.6 - The DLVO potential with contributions from the osmotic pressure (repulsive) and the dispersion force (attractive)</em></p>
</div>

At short range ($ < 10 nm$) the repulsive pressures are high until below a
critical separation of $\sim 4nm$ the pressure becomes attractive as
dispersion forces dominate. It is the large positive pressures in the
range $4-10nm$ which stop the surfaces from sticking together when they
approach. However, if the surfaces are pushed together with pressures
that exceed $\sim 4000Pa$, the surfaces will adhere to one another.

The inset shows that at long range ($\> 18nm$ in this case) the pressure
is weakly attractive and that at a separation of $\sim 18nm$ there is no net
pressure on the surfaces. This corresponds to the equilibrium separation
of the surfaces under these conditions.

### The effects of adding electrolyte

As more salt is added, electrostatic effects are more strongly screened
eventually attractive dispersion forces dominate and surfaces will
stick together. This is manifested as a reduction in the height of the
repulsive pressure barrier until finally, the pressure becomes
negative for all values of the inter-surface separation, $D$.
