**Aggregation** We have seen that particles and surfaces can interact
via many different physical interactions (e.g. dispersion, double layer
and steric forces). The subtle balance between these interactions
determines whether the particles/surfaces will remain separated in
solution.

When the interactions between particles
favour the attraction of particles, they will tend to aggregate. If
these interactions become really strong, they will eventually drive
phase separation in the system and the components will unmix forming
effectively infinite aggregates.

## Why do aggregates form?

When the energy per particle/molecule associated with a
particle/molecule inside an aggregate is less than the energy of a free
molecule, then aggregates will start to form. If this average energy
becomes lower (more favourable/negative) the bigger the aggregate gets,
then the aggregate will continue to grow.

</div>

The shape of the aggregate that forms will depend upon the nature of the
interactions between individual molecules. If for example, the molecules
have highly directional interactions at opposite ends, they will tend to
link up to form long chains or one dimensional aggregates. If the
molecules interact in two dimensions they will tend to form discs or
planar aggregates. And if the interactions are isotropic (i.e. the same
in all directions), the molecules will tend to form three dimensional aggregates, droplets or clusters.

## Chemical potential of a molecule

In order for an aggregate to grow the change in the free energy when
an additional molecule or particle is added must be negative. We define
the chemical potential $\mu$ of an aggregate as the rate of change of the
free energy with particle number $N$.

$\mu = \frac{dU}{dN}$

As we will see the chemical potential depends upon the shape of the
aggregates and the number of particles in the aggregate ($N$)

## One Dimensional aggregates (rods)

Consider a linear aggregate where all the $N$ particles/molecules are
joined together in a line. Most particles have 2 bonds which we will say results in a negative change in the free energy ${\mu}_{Bulk}$. The two particles on the end each
have an exposed surface with one bond each that is unsatisfied. This is
equivalent to one particle with two unsatisfied bonds. 

<div style="text-align: center;">

    <p><em>Figure 15.2 - Overlap of the excluded volumes of two spheres.</em></p>
</div>

One way to write the energy change down is to firstly write the free energy change of $N$
normal particles and then add a correction for the "one particle" which
has unsatisified bonds.

$$U = U_{Bulk} + U_{surface} = - N\mu_{Bulk} + 1*\mu_{Bulk} = - (N - 1)\mu_{Bulk}$$

To calculate the change in the free energy we differentiate this expression:

$$\mu = \frac{dU}{dN} = - \mu_{Bulk} < 0$$

Since this value is always negative adding a single molecule to a linear
aggregate will always be favourable. As a result, molecules that form
these kind of aggregates will tend to form very long (essentially
infinite) rods or fibres.

## Two dimensional aggregates (discs)

The case of 2D aggregation is slightly more complicated. As a disc-like aggregate grows the area of the surface on which the particles attach increases with the radius of the disc. The production of this excess surface area has an energy penalty associated with it.

    <p><em>Figure 15.3 - A 2D disc aggregate.</em></p>
</div>


How many molecules are required to form an aggregate of radius $R$?
Equating the volume of the aggregate with the volume of the $N$ molecules
from which it is made and rearranging gives:

$$R = \ \left( \frac{Nv}{\pi t} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$$

Following the same logic as for the 1D aggregate, we will work out the
bulk energy of N particles but then correct for those particles at the
edge of the aggregate that have unsatisfied bonds. In this case the
surface correction term is related to the area of the exposed edge and
we also define the surface energy per unit area $\gamma$. We then substitute
for $R$ to obtain the expression for $U$.

$$U = U_{Bulk} + U_{Surface} = - N\mu_{Bulk} + 2\pi Rt\gamma = \  - N\mu_{Bulk} + 2\gamma(\pi tvN)^{\frac{1}{2}}$$

Differentiating with respect to $N$ gives an expression for the chemical potential:

$$\mu = \frac{dU}{dN} = - \mu_{bulk} + \gamma\left( \frac{\pi tv}{N} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$$

## Three Dimensional aggregates (spheres)

Similarly for 3D aggregation we consider bulk and surface terms:

1.  Work out how $N$ is related to $R$ ðŸ¡ª $N = \left(\frac{4Ï€R^{3}}{3\nu}\right)$

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/13_4.png" alt="excluded volume" width="250" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 15.4 - 3D spherical aggregate.</em></p>
</div>

2.  Write down energy of bulk and surface

$$U = U_{Bulk} + U_{Surface} = -N{\mu}_{Bulk} + 4{\pi}R^{2}{\gamma}$$

3.  Simplify expression to remove dependence on R

4.   
$${\mu} = \frac{dU}{dN}$$

$$\mu = - \mu_{bulk} + \frac{8\pi\gamma}{3}\left( \frac{3v}{4\pi} \right)^{\frac{2}{3}}\left( \frac{1}{N} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}$$

## What happens as the aggregation number increases? 

For a 1D aggregate we saw that the chemical potential is always negative
and so aggregates grow regardless of $N$. However, for 2 and 3D aggregates
this is not necessarily the case.

$$\mathrm{\Delta}U(N + 1) = \ \frac{dU}{dN}((N + 1) - N)$$

Whether this change is positive depends on the sign of the chemical
potential.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/13_5.png" alt="excluded volume" width="250" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 15.5 - Free energy of a growing spherical aggregate</em></p>
</div>

A plot of the free energy shows that the gradient $\frac{dU}{dN}$ is positive for
$N < N_{c}$ and negative above this value. This means that for 2 and 3D
aggregates adding a single molecule to a small aggregate ($N < N_{c}$) will
be unfavourable. Consequently, if you were to place a ready formed
aggregate of $N < N_{c}$ molecules in solution it would fall apart in order
to decrease the free energy of the system. However, once a critical
nucleus ($N=N_{c}$) of molecules has been formed it becomes favourable for
the aggregate to grow. There is therefore an energy barrier to
aggregation for isolated molecules in solution which must be overcome if
an aggregate is to grow. The size of this critical nucleus occurs at the
turning point (${\mu} = \frac{dU}{dN}$)

For a 2D aggregate this gives:

$$N_{c} = {\pi tv\left( \frac{\gamma}{\mu_{B}} \right)}^{2}$$

and for 3D:

$$N_{c} = \left( \frac{3v}{4\pi} \right)^{2}\left( \frac{8\pi\gamma}{{3\mu}_{B}} \right)^{3}$$

## So how do 2D and 3D aggregates start growing? 

Since all aggregates start off as individual particles this raises the
question as to how 2D or 3D aggregates can start growing. We have seen
that to grow, a critical cluster size has to form before it becomes
energetically favourable for the aggregation to continue. The formation
of these clusters or nuclei can happen in one of two ways.

1)  Homogeneous nucleation

2)  Heterogeneous nucleation

**Homogeneous nucleation is where thermal fluctuations force enough
molecules together to form a cluster/nucleus of the required size.**
This is usually extremely unlikely and therefore takes a very long time.
There is an energy barrier that must be overcome by a chance
fluctuation. For a 3D aggregate this energy barrier has a height of

$$\mathrm{\Delta}U = \frac{\mu_{Bulk}N_{c}}{2}$$

The probability of this energy being supplied by chance is given by
Boltzmann statistics:

$$P(N = Nc) = \ e^{- \mathrm{\Delta}U/k_{B}T}$$

$$P(N = Nc) = \ e^{- \mu_{Bulk}N_{c}/2k_{B}T}$$

Thus the probability of Homogeneous nucleation is strongly dependent on
the bulk cohesive energy, the size of aggregate and the temperature.
Hence aggregation is faster at higher temperatures. This is often a very
small probability, meaning that nucleation takes a long time or
effectively never takes place.

**Heterogeneous nucleation is where foreign surfaces nucleate the
formation of a critical cluster size by introducing additional
interactions.** (Heterogeneous nucleation). These foreign surfaces can
simply be dust particles, or the surfaces of a container in which the
material is being held. This mechanism is usually the cause of nucleus
formation in 'dirty' samples.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/13_6.png" alt="excluded volume" width="450" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 15.6 - Overlap of the excluded volumes of two spheres.</em></p>
</div>

If an aggregate forms on an impurity, it results in less exposed surface
area reducing the size of the correction U~surface~. This results in a
smaller critical aggregate size and a lower energy barrier to
nucleation. Consequently, it is easier for an aggregate to form under
these conditions.
