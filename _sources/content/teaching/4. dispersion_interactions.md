# 4. Dispersion Interactions

Dispersion interactions are always present and act between all
atoms and molecules. This is in contrast to other types of interaction
such as ionic and covalent interactions, which may or may not be present
depending upon the type of atoms/ions/molecules in a material.

Dispersion interactions are dipole-dipole interactions, which arise as
the result of temporary local fluctuations in charge density on
atoms/molecules.

1.  Temporary fluctuations in charge density create an **instantaneous
    dipole** on one atom/molecule.

2.  The resulting electric field produced by this dipole then **induces
    a dipole** in a neighbouring atom/molecule

3.  A force is exerted between the two correlated dipoles.

## Properties of dispersion forces

-   Are attractive

-   Tend to have a weak orientational effect on neighbouring
    atoms/molecules

-   Can be relatively long ranged between macroscopic bodies ($0.2nm$ to $> 10nm$)

-   They play a role in a many important phenomena such as adhesion,
    surface tension, wetting, flocculation and aggregation of particles.

## Potential energy due to dispersion interactions

The potential energy of the dispersion interaction (and indeed any
interaction) is a useful tool in helping us to determine the force
between two nanoscale objects, as the force is simply related to the
spatial derivative of the potential. We can determine the potential
energy of an induced dipole in the E-field due to an instantaneous
dipole by using the concepts relating to polar interactions developed
already.

Consider an instantaneous dipole of magnitude $p=qd$ on an
atom/molecule at the origin (where $q$ is the magnitude of the charge
and $d$ is the separation between the positive and negative charges in
the resulting dipole).

If a second atom having polarisability, $\alpha$, is placed at a distance, $x$,
from the origin, this atom will experience a separation of charge and
will have an induced dipole moment:

$$\mathbf{p} = \alpha\mathbf{E}$$

However, we have already shown that the electric field due to the first
dipole can be approximated to:

$$\mathbf{E} = \frac{qd}{2\pi\varepsilon\varepsilon_{0}}\frac{1}{x^{3}}\mathbf{i}$$

Also, we know that the potential energy of a dipole in an electric field
is given by:

$$U_{dipole} = - \mathbf{p}.\mathbf{E}$$

Combining these three results gives the potential energy of the induced
dipole in the electric field due to the instantaneous dipole as:

$$U(x) = - \frac{\alpha(qd)^{2}}{\left( 2\pi\varepsilon\varepsilon_{0} \right)^{2}}\frac{1}{x^{6}}\mathbf{= -}\frac{C}{x^{6}}$$

where C is a constant ($Jm^{6}$) which determines the *strength* of the interaction between the two atoms. This expression is the potential energy due to the dispersion interaction between two atoms, but is equally valid for the dispersion interaction between molecules.

The key point is that the potential energy due to dispersion
interactions has a power law dependence which decays as $1/x^{6}$. These
interactions therefore decay much faster than for example the coulomb
interaction which has a much longer ranged $1/x^{2}$ dependence.

## Dispersion Forces

Having derived an expression for the dispersion interaction potential
energy, we can determine the force exerted on each of the two atoms by
calculating the derivative of the potential, such that:

$$F(x) = - \frac{dU}{dx} = - \frac{6\alpha(qd)^{2}}{\left( 2\pi\varepsilon\varepsilon_{0} \right)^{2}}\frac{1}{x^{7}}\mathbf{= -}\frac{6C}{x^{7}}$$

### The Range of Dispersion interactions

When the dispersion potential energy becomes comparable to thermal
energies, these interactions will start to become less important. We can
calculate the range of the dispersion interaction at a given
temperature, $T$, by equating the dispersion potential energy with the
thermal energy.

$$\left| U(x) \right| = \frac{\alpha(qd)^{2}}{\left( 2\pi\varepsilon\varepsilon_{0} \right)^{2}}\frac{1}{x_{range}^{6}}\mathbf{\approx}kT$$

Rearranging this expression gives:

$$x_{range} \approx \left( \frac{\alpha(qd)^{2}}{\left( 2\pi\varepsilon\varepsilon_{0} \right)^{2}kT} \right)^{1/6}$$

Inserting typical values of $\alpha=9 \times 10^{-40},  C^{2}m^{2}J^{-1}$ and $p=qd=5 \times 10^{-30}Cm$ for individual atoms at $T=300K$ gives a value of around $0.3nm$ for the range of interaction. This distance is comparable to the radius an atom ($\sim 0.1nm$) and shows that dispersion interactions between atoms, while being short range, are strong enough to hold atoms in close contact against the effects of thermal agitation. These types of interactions are responsible for holding simple liquids and some organic solids together.

## Why don't atoms and molecules collapse in on one another?

The form of the dispersion potential predicts that interactions get
stronger as atoms and molecules get closer together i.e. the forces
become more attractive the closer they get to one another. So what prevents atoms and molecules from collapsing into one another?

The simple answer is that there must be an even shorter range repulsive
interaction which exerts a larger force than that generated by
dispersion forces when the atoms and molecules come into close contact.
This short-range interaction arises due to the Pauli exclusion
principle:

**"Two or more electrons may not have the same quantum state."**

In other words, overlap of electron clouds of two atoms is strongly
repulsive. However, this is not something that we can derive from
first principles so instead we use an empirical potential of the form,

$$U(x) = + \frac{B}{x^{12}}$$

### The Lennard-Jones (6-12) potential

The total interatomic/molecular potential between two atoms or molecules
is therefore given by summing the attractive and repulsive potentials,
as discovered by Prof. Lennard-Jones,

$$U(x) = + \frac{B}{x^{12}}\mathbf{-}\frac{C}{x^{6}}\mathbf{=}4\gamma\left\lbrack \left( \frac{\sigma}{x} \right)^{12} - \left( \frac{\sigma}{x} \right)^{6} \right\rbrack$$

where B, C, $\gamma$ and $\sigma$ are all constants.

The plot below shows the shape of the attractive, repulsive and total
(attractive + repulsive) potentials as a function of the separation
between the atoms/molecules.

    <p><em>Figure 4.2 - Plot of the Lennard-Jones potential showing both the short range repulsive force and longer range attractive force.</em></p>
</div>

The force exerted on each of the atoms/molecules is given by taking the
derivative of the Lennard Jones potential and gives:

$$F(x) = 4\gamma\left\lbrack 12\frac{\sigma^{12}}{x^{13}} - 6\frac{\sigma^{6}}{x^{7}} \right\rbrack$$

The form of the force versus the separation between the atoms/molecules
is plotted below in reduced units.

The equilibrium separation occurs when F=0 i.e. when the derivative of
the potential is zero. At distances less than $\sim 1.1\sigma$, the net (total) force is positive and
therefore repulsive. At distances greater than $1.1\sigma$, the net (total) force is negative and
therefore attractive.

## Dispersion interactions between extended bodies

We have considered the dispersion interaction between isolated atoms and
molecules. From here we can start to work out how dispersion
interactions affect the forces that are exerted on extended and
macroscopic bodies that are made up of many atoms/molecules.

Recall that the dispersion potential energy between isolated
atoms/molecules has the form

$$U(x) = \mathbf{-}\frac{C}{x^{6}}$$

**This power law dependence of the potential does not hold for macroscopic objects that contain many atoms/molecules.**

So what happens when many atoms/molecules come together? The answer to this question is relatively simple. If the interaction energy between an atom/molecule and one of its nearest neighbours is given by $U$, then an atom that is surrounded by
*N* nearest neighbours will have a potential energy of order $NU$. In reality, it is not always quite this simple, but this argument is correct in the sense that the more atoms/molecules we have in a cluster, the greater the magnitude of the total potential energy associated with the interactions will be. This means that by bringing many atoms/molecules together we can increase the cohesive energy of the resulting cluster.

Increasing the cluster size only works up to a point, as next nearest neighbours and next-next nearest neighbours experience an increasingly weaker interaction with the central atom/molecule. However, these effects can be strong enough to hold some liquids and some organic solids together, particularly if the molecules that comprise these materials are large and thus able to experience many interactions with neighbouring molecules.

A classic example of molecules held together by dispersion forces are the linear alkanes. These are linear chains of carbon atoms with single bonds between them. Each carbon atom in the chain has two hydrogen atoms attached to it (except at the ends, where each carbon atom has three hydrogen atoms attached to it). The lower alkanes such as methane ($CH_{4}$) and ethane ($C_{2}H_{6}$) are gases. However, as the length of the alkane chain is increased, these materials form liquids such as octane ($C_{8}H_{18}$) and eventually solids such as $C_{18}H_{36}$. In each case the number of interactions between neighbouring molecules determines their cohesive energy and hence the physical state of the material.
