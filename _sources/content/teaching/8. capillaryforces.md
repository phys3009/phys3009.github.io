### Pressure difference across a liquid interface {#pressure-difference-across-a-liquid-interface .H3}

What happens if the surface between two liquids becomes curved?
Consider, the water-air interface of some water in a tube.

In the last lecture we showed that there is an energy cost associated
with increasing the area of a surface. A curved surface has a larger
area than a flat one.

will use the principal of virtual work. That is we will ask the
question, how much work would we need to do to change the curvature of
the liquid interface? This work must then be equal in magnitude to the
potential energy stored in the curved interface. From this information
we will be able to determine the magnitude of the forces or the pressure
(force per unit area) acting at the interface.

We start by considering a curved liquid/air interface which has two
principal radii of curvature, R~1~ and R~2~, (see diagram on right).

There is a pressure difference across a curved liquid interface which
acts to try to reduce the area of the interface. This is called the
**Capillary Pressure**

$$\Delta P = P_{1} - P_{2} = \gamma\left( \frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{R_{2}} \right)$$

where γ is surface energy/tension (Jm^-2^)

*R~1~* and *R~2~* are principal radii of curvature in two orthogonal
(perpendicular) directions

![liquidcolumn](media/image82.jpeg){width="0.23541666666666666in"
height="1.0013888888888889in"}When a fine capillary is placed inside a
liquid, a curved liquid meniscus forms. The resulting pressure drop
across the interface causes the fluid to be drawn up inside the
capillary. This is phenomena is referred to as **capillary rise** and
can be observed routinely in a laboratory.

The height of fluid (*h*) in a capillary of radius, *R,* is determined
by **balancing the capillary pressure drop across the meniscus with the
pressure required to draw the fluid up the capillary.**

For a fluid of density, ρ, and surface tension, γ, 

$$h = \frac{2\gamma cos\theta}{\rho gR}$$

Capillary pressure due to a curved liquid interface

$$P = \gamma\left( \frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{R_{2}} \right)$$

Capillary pressure is responsible for the phenomenon of capillary rise

$$h = \frac{2\gamma cos\theta}{\rho gR}$$
