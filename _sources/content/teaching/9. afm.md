## Forces at the Nanoscale

Forces between nanoscale objects typically occur in the range $1pN-1nN$
and can be difficult to measure. To measure these forces we ideally require a measurement system where the change in applied force gives a linear response in the measurement device (although this is not necessary).

In this chapter we will study experimental techniques that can be used
to measure nanoscale forces directly. The first of these techniques is
Atomic Force Microscopy

## Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)

In the first year 'Frontiers in Physics' module, you considered how
atomic force microscopy can be used to image the surface of a sample.
There are two main imaging modes in AFM:

### Contact mode

A sharp tip is mounted on a cantilever and brought into contact with the
surface to be studied. As the tip is dragged along the surface, the
cantilever deflects. If we track the position of the cantilever we can
build up an image of surface as the tip moves along. The contact between
tip and sample can be quite destructive, so this mode of imaging is
usually reserved for hard samples.

    <p><em>Figure 9.1 - AFM operated in contact mode, where tip is always touching the sample.</em></p>
</div>

### Tapping mode

A tip mounted on a cantilever is oscillated at its resonant frequency and brought close to a surface. The tip-sample interaction causes the resonant frequency of the cantilever to shift by an amount which depends upon the tip-sample separation and the local gradient of the force. If we move the tip across the surface and vary the tip-sample separation in such a way that the resonant frequency remains constant, we can build up images of constant force gradient. For a uniform, chemically homogeneous sample this corresponds to an image of the topography (or height variations). We can thus build up images of the surface structure in a similar way to that used in contact mode. However, the advantage of this technique is that the tip spends very little time in contact with the surface and is less destructive. This technique is therefore more suitable for imaging soft samples.

## Force Measurements using the AFM

AFM can also be used to measure forces. If an AFM tip is brought into contact with a surface, the forces on the tip will cause the cantilever on which it is mounted to deflect. The AFM cantilever bends/deflects in response to an applied force. The applied force is given by $F = kz$

The spring constant of the cantilever can be derived using the physics
of elastic beams and is given by $k = \frac{3EI}{l^{3}}$ where $E$ is the Youngs Modulus of the cantilever ($Pa$), $l$ is its length and $I$ is its geometric  moment of inertia ($m^{4}$).

### Detecting the deflection of the cantilever  

If small ($pN - nN$) forces are exerted on the cantilever, then the displacements of the cantilever are likely to be small ($pm - nm$). Our ability to detect small forces is controlled partly by the design of the cantilever and partly by the instrumentation used to detect the deflections of the cantilever.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/9_3.png" alt="tapping mode" width="250" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 9.3 - The deflection of the cantilever is detected by reflecting a laser off the back of the cantilever</em></p>
</div>

The most common method of detecting cantilever deflections is to reflect
a laser beam off the back of the cantilever. The laser light is collected using a position sensitive photodetector, called a split photodiode, which produces an output current that varies with the position of the laser beam on the detector. These detectors are simple two photodiodes (PD) that are connected to a differential amplifier in such a way that the output signal is proportional to the difference in intensity detected by the two photodiodes. The diagram
below shows a laser spot falling on a split photodiode detector and a
bar graph showing the measured intensities at the two photodiodes. 

### Interpreting the photodiode signal

The split photodiodes are connected to a differential current amplifier which produces a signal that is proportional to the difference in photocurrents generated by the two diodes

$$i_{signal} = i_{1} - i_{2}$$

If $i_{signal} > 0$ force acts upwards If $i_{signal} < 0$ force acts downwards.

The detection efficiency of the photodiodes is such that cantilever displacements as small as 0.1 nm can be routinely detected. This means that forces in the sub nN range can easily be measured using AFM.

## Calibrating the spring constant of the cantilever

In practice, it is often difficult to calculate the spring constant of a cantilever, so it has to be calibrated prior to a measurement. Reasons for this might include the fact that the Young's Modulus or dimensions of the cantilever are not known with sufficient precision to calculate the spring constant.

### Calibration: Thermal tuning of the cantilever

This method involves measuring the natural response of the cantilever in response to thermal motion. When the cantilever is agitated by thermal motions of the atoms around it, it starts to vibrate. Vibrations at the resonant frequency of the cantilever occur much more easily than vibrations at other frequencies (which are heavily damped).

If we monitor the displacement of the cantilever $z$ obtained from the noise signal when the cantilever is not being driven, we obtain something like the signal shown below:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/9_5.png" alt="noise signal" width="350" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 9.5 - Noise signal from a thermally driven cantilever</em></p>
</div>

We can calculate the mean square displacement of the cantilever $<z^{2}\>$ from the data shown in the plot. We then assume that the potential energy stored in the cantilever is comparable to the thermal energy provided by its surroundings to give

$$\frac{1}{2}k\left\langle z^{2} \right\rangle = \frac{1}{2}k_{B}T$$

Note: the factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ on the right hand side comes from equipartition theory (more on this in Thermal Physics), but the thermal energy is still of order $k_{B}T$, where $k_{B}$ is Boltzmann's constant. Rearranging
this equation gives:

$$k = \frac{k_{B}T}{\left\langle z^{2} \right\rangle}$$

Hence the spring constant of the cantilever can be determined using a knowledge of the temperature, $T$, and measurements of the mean square displacement of the cantilever under the influence of natural thermal vibrations.

### Force detection limits in AFM

In an AFM a typical cantilever spring constant is $\sim 0.01-50 Nm^{-1}$. We can routinely measure cantilever displacements of $\sim 0.1nm$. We can therefore measure forces $> 10 pN$ with relative ease using AFM.

## Force vs. distance curves

AFM can be used to map out the strength of dispersion (and other) forces as a function of the distance between sample and tip.

### Protein (un)folding

AFM is routinely used to map out the forces associated with the folding and unfolding of individual protein molecules.

## Moving the AFM tip with nanoscale precision -- Piezo electric motors 

In order to build up images with an AFM one must scan the tip backwards
and forwards across a sample building up a 2D map of the force measured
at different points. In order to do this successfully one must be able to move the position of the tip with sub-nanoscale precision. AFMs and other similar
technology accomplish this using motors based on the piezo-electric
effect.

</div>

Certain kinds of crystal are called piezo-electric crystals (e.g quartz). These crystals become polarized when subjected to a stress / strain. The diagram above shows how when a crystal containing equal numbers of positive and negative elements is deformed by an external force it results in the formation of a dipole. As a result of the dipole an
electric field is developed across the sample.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/9_9.png" alt="piezo force" width="350" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 9.9 - Electric field generated by compressing a piezo electric crystal such as quartz.</em></p>
</div>

The same effect however can work in reverse. If an electric field is applied across the sample this will deform the sample due to the forces acting on +ve and -ve elements resulting in expansion or contraction along one dimension.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/9_10.png" alt="piezo drive" width="350" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 9.10 - Electric field deforms the piezo electric crystal creating a force</em></p>
</div>

This controlled expansion is usually very small. Stacking these crystals and electrodes it is possible to make very
precise motors capable of controlled motions well below a nanometre by changing the applied voltage.

</div>

The changes in a piezo-electric crystal can be related by the following
equations.

$$P = \  - d\sigma + \alpha E$$

$$\varepsilon = \frac{\sigma}{Y} + dE$$

P is the polarization, d is the piezo-electric constant, α is the
polarizability of the material, E is the electric field. ɛ is the linear
strain ie change in length / original length. Y is the young's modulus.
