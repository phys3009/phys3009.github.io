## Cohesive energy of bulk atoms and surface atoms

In the bulk of a material, atoms and molecules are surrounded by
$N_{Bulk}$ nearest neighbours.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/7_1.png" alt="H Bonds" width="200" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 7.1 - Molecule in the bulk of some material.</em></p>
</div>

If each interaction with the central atom/molecule has an energy, $-u$
the total interaction energy becomes

$$U_{Bulk} = -N_{Bulk}u$$

When we create a surface in material and expose it to vacuum each
surface atom/molecule has fewer nearest neighbours

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/7_2.png" alt="Surface" width="150" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 7.2 - Molecule at the surface of some material.</em></p>
</div>

The interaction energy per atom/molecule is then

$$U_{surf} = -N_{surf}u$$

There is therefore an excess amount of energy associated with each surface atom / molecule.

$$\Delta U = U_{surf} -U_{Bulk} = (N_{Bulk} - N_{surf})u$$

Since this is positive it is unfavourable.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/7_3.png" alt="Surface energy" width="400" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 7.3 - Surface energy.</em></p>
</div>

**Surface energy** is the excess energy required per unit area to create a surface in a vacuum. The energy required to create two new surfaces in a material, each having area $S$ is $W = 2\gamma S$ where $\gamma$ is the surface energy of the material in $Jm^{-2}$.

### Calculating the surface energy of simple materials from inter-surface potentials

The surface energy of a material can also be thought of as the energy
required to separate two surfaces from their inter-atomic/molecular
distance, $D_{0}$, and to remove them to infinity.

In lectures we showed that the potential energy due to dispersion interactions between two surfaces, $U$, is given by $U = - \frac{AS}{12\pi D_{0}^{2}}$ where _A_ is the Hamaker constant (J) and _S_ is the area of the surfaces ($m^{2}$). This is also the energy required to separate the two surfaces from a separation $D_{o}$ to infinity. We would expect therefore that the surface energy should be equal to half this potential energy (as there are two surfaces) per unit area.

This gives:

$${\gamma = - \frac{U}{2S} = \frac{A}{24\pi D_{0}^{2}}}$$

### Do calculations agree with experiments?

### Work of Adhesion

The energy required per unit area to separate two surfaces of materials
1 and 2 in a third medium (medium 3) is called the _work of adhesion_
($W$). It is the energy required to break the interface between two materials
and form two new interfaces.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/7_5.png" alt="Table" width="500" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 7.5 - Work of adhesion</em></p>
</div>

$$W = \gamma_{13} + \gamma_{23} - \gamma_{12}$$

**Interfacial energy** is the excess energy per unit area required to
create an interface between two different materials.

This standard definition can sometimes confuse people. $\gamma_{12}$ is an interfacial energy and so is $\gamma_{23}$. Though we speak about "creating" an interface we mean the energy associated with the contact between two materials. Since those contacts change when we pull a material apart the work of adhesion measures the difference in those interfacial energies. The surface energy is very similar but concerns the specific case where a material surface is in contact with a vacuum. Often when the surface is in contact with air the difference is very small but strictly a material in air has an interfacial energy.

## Surface and interfacial tension

Surface/interfacial tension is the force required per unit length to
extend a surface/interface (measured in $Nm^{-1}$). This is actually the
same thing as the surface energy. Consider:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/7_6.png" alt="Surface" width="400" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 7.6 - Stretching an interface</em></p>
</div>

The energy ($dU$) required to increase the area of the liquid surface in the diagram by a small amount $Ldx$ is $dU = \gamma Ldx$. The magnitude of the force exerted on the barrier is therefore $T = - F = \frac{dU}{dx} = \gamma L$. So $\gamma = T/l$.

This means that surface energy $\gamma$ is also the force acting per unit length at a liquid interface (also called surface tension). Similarly, interfacial energy and interfacial tension are the same quantity.

### Why is a suspended droplet spherical?

A sphere has the minimum surface area for any given volume of fluid. Any
shape other than a sphere will therefore result in an increased surface
area $dA$ and a consequent increase in the free energy $dG = \gamma_{12} dA$.
Alternatively one could think of this in terms of the surface tension which pulls inwards equally in all directions leading to a spherical shape.

## Wetting interactions and contact angles

If a droplet is placed on a surface the
shape is more complicated. Surface and interfacial energies determine
how macroscopic liquid droplets deform when they adhere to a surface

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/7_8.png" alt="droplet" width="400" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 7.8 - Contact angle of a droplet on a surface</em></p>
</div>

If we define $S = \gamma_{vs} - \gamma_{ls} - \gamma_{vl}$, a partially wetting film has $S < 0$ whereas a wetting film (one that spreads out into a thin layer) will have $S >= 0$. The contact angle made between a droplet and a surface is determined by a subtle balance of the interfacial energies/tensions.

## Cohesive v Adhesive Forces

The angle a liquid makes with a surface is controlled by a balance
between the cohesive and adhesive forces.

- _Cohesive_ - interactions with other molecules of the same type

- _Adhesive_ - interactions with other molecules of a different material
  or liquid

If a surface has a small / large contact angle with water then it is
known as _hydrophilic_ / _hydrophobic_. Small and large are relative
terms used to compare different surfaces but usually a hydrophobic
surface would have a contact angle $\sim 90^{\circ}$.

## Superhydrophobicity

Under certain situations if a surface contains microstructures it is
possible to achieve contact angles as high or greater than 160˚. This is
due to the fact that only a small portion of the droplet actually
touches the surface. Under these circumstances it is possible for the
droplet to simply roll off the surface with even a small angle of
inclination. These structures occur naturally (eg the Lotus Leaf) but
are also especially manufactured for various applications.
