### ![](media/image60.png){width="1.7458333333333333in" height="2.2222222222222223in"}Cohesive energy of bulk atoms and surface atoms {#cohesive-energy-of-bulk-atoms-and-surface-atoms .H3}

In the bulk of a material, atoms and molecules are surrounded by
*N~Bulk~* nearest neighbours.

If each interaction with the central atom/molecule has an energy, *-u,*
the total interaction energy becomes

*U~Bulk~ = -N~Bulk~u*

When we create a surface in material and expose it to vacuum each
surface atom/molecule has fewer nearest neighbours

height="1.9520833333333334in"}*N~surf~ \< N~Bulk~*

The interaction energy per atom/molecule is then

*U~surf~ = -N~surf~u*

There is therefore an excess amount of energy

*∆U = U~surf~* -*U~Bulk~* *= (N~Bulk~ - N~surf~ ) u*

associated with each surface atom/molecule. Since this is positive it is
unfavourable.

height="1.3618055555555555in"}**Surface energy** is the excess energy
required per unit area to create a surface in a vacuum

The energy required to create two new surfaces in a material, each
having area *S* is

$$W = 2\gamma S$$

where *γ*  is the surface energy of the material in Jm^-2^.

The surface energy of a material can also be thought of as the energy
required to separate two surfaces from their inter-atomic/molecular
distance, D~o~, and to remove them to infinity.

In lectures we showed that the potential energy due to dispersion
interactions between two surfaces, *U,* is given by

$U = - \frac{AS}{12\pi D_{0}^{2}}$

where *A* is the Hamaker constant (J) and *S* is the area of the
surfaces (m^2^)

This is also the energy required to separate the two surfaces from a
separation D~o~ to infinity. We would expect therefore that the surface
energy should be equal to half this potential energy (as there are two
surfaces) per unit area.

This gives:

$
$

$$
{\gamma = - \frac{U}{2S} = \frac{A}{24\pi D_{0}^{2}}}$$

**Do calculations agree with experiments?**

### Work of Adhesion {#work-of-adhesion .H3}

The energy required per unit area to separate two surfaces of materials
1 and 2 in a third medium (medium 3) is called the *work of adhesion
(W)*.

It is the energy required to break the interface between two materials
and form two new interfaces.

$$W = \underset{creation\ of\ new\ surfaces}{\overset{\gamma_{13} + \gamma_{23}}{︸}} - \underset{breaking\ of\ initial\ bonds}{\overset{\gamma_{12}}{︸}}$$

**Interfacial energy** is the excess energy per unit area required to
create an interface between two different materials.

The interfacial energy between materials 1 and 2 is represented by
*γ~12~*

### Surface and interfacial tension {#surface-and-interfacial-tension .H3}

Surface/interfacial tension is the force required per unit length to
extend a surface/interface (measured in Nm^-1^). This is actually the
same thing as the surface energy. Consider:

![](media/image69.png){width="3.698611111111111in"
height="1.9215277777777777in"}The energy (dU) required to increase the
area of the liquid surface in the diagram by a small amount Ldx is

$$dU = \gamma Ldx$$

The magnitude of the force exerted on the barrier is therefore

$$T = - F = \frac{dU}{dx} = \gamma L$$

So $\gamma = T/l$

**So surface energy γ is also the force acting per unit length at a
liquid interface (also called surface tension). Similarly, interfacial
energy and interfacial tension are the same quantity**

### ![](media/image70.png){width="2.408333333333333in" height="2.3305555555555557in"}Why is a suspended droplet spherical? {#why-is-a-suspended-droplet-spherical .H3}

A sphere has the minimum surface area for any given volume of fluid. Any
shape other than a sphere will therefore result in an increased surface
area dA and a consequent increase in the free energy dG = γ~12~dA.
Alternatively one could think of this in terms of the surface tension
which pulls inwards equally in all directions leading to a spherical
shape.

### Wetting interactions and contact angles {#wetting-interactions-and-contact-angles .H3}

shape is more complicated. Surface and interfacial energies determine
how macroscopic liquid droplets deform when they adhere to a surface

height="1.4097222222222223in"}The contact angle made between a droplet
and a surface is determined by a subtle balance of the interfacial
energies/tensions.

### Cohesive v Adhesive Forces {#cohesive-v-adhesive-forces .H3}

The angle a liquid makes with a surface is controlled by a balance
between the cohesive and adhesive forces.

"Cohesive" -- interactions with other molecules of the same type

"Adhesive" -- interactions with other molecules of a different material
or liquid

If a surface has a small / large contact angle with water then it is
known as "hydrophilic" / "hydrophobic". Small and large are relative
terms used to compare different surfaces but usually a hydrophobic
surface would have a contact angle \~ 90˚.

### Superhydrophobicity {#superhydrophobicity .H3}

Under certain situations if a surface contains microstructures it is
possible to achieve contact angles as high or greater than 160˚. This is
due to the fact that only a small portion of the droplet actually
touches the surface. Under these circumstances it is possible for the
droplet to simply roll off the surface with even a small angle of
inclination. These structures occur naturally (eg the Lotus Leaf) but
are also especially manufactured for various applications.
