Optical tweezers provide a way of manipulating atoms and molecules, as
well as nano or micron scale objects. They can also be used to measure
very small forces. These instruments work by trapping small particles in a focussed laser
beam. Once trapped, particles can be manipulated by simply steering the
laser around.

## The wave nature of light 

Light is an electromagnetic wave. As it propagates through vacuum or a medium it carries energy. The energy is stored in electric and magnetic fields that oscillate in a direction perpendicular to the direction of travel of the waves. As the light travels along, the Electric field at a given time, $t$, and point, $x$, in space will vary according to the equation

$$
E = E_{0}\sin(\omega t - kx)
$$

where $E_{0}$ is the amplitude of the wave, $\omega$ is its angular frequency
and $k$ is called the wavenumber ($k=2{\pi}/{\lambda}$, where $\lambda$  is the wavelength of the light).

### Intensity

The time averaged intensity of light, $I$ ($Wm^{-2}$), can be related to the
magnitude of the electric field, $E$, by the relationship

$$\left\langle I \right\rangle = \frac{c\varepsilon\varepsilon_{0}n}{2}\left\langle E^{2} \right\rangle$$

Where $c$ is the speed of light ($ms^-1$) and $n$ is the refractive index
of the medium in which it propagates. All other constants have their
usual definitions.

Note: For a sinusoidal oscillating field, the time average value of
$\left<E^{2}\right>$ is not zero. So the intensity is not zero! In fact, it is
equal to $\frac{1}{2}E_{0}^{2}$. 

**The key point here is that intensity is proportional to the electric
field squared**

## Optical trapping of particles

Small dielectric (insulating) particles experience a force when illuminated with visible light. If a dielectric particle is placed in an intensity gradient a force is exerted on the particle such that it will move to a region of higher intensity. To understand the origin of this effect we must consider the interaction between the dielectric particles and the incident laser light radiation.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/10_3.png" alt="gradient intensity" width="150" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 10.3 - Force acts along the gradient in intensity of the beam from the edge towards the centre. </em></p>
</div>

When a particle is placed in a laser beam, the electric field associated with the incident light will cause a slight separation of charges in the particle material and thus induce a dipole moment on the particle. This dipole moment will then interact with the field which caused it to form. So in one dimension the force on a dielectric particle is:

$$\mathbf{F} = - \frac{dU}{dx}\mathbf{i =}\frac{2\alpha}{c\varepsilon\varepsilon_{0}n}\frac{dI}{dx}\mathbf{i}$$

Generalising this to three dimensions we obtain:

$\mathbf{F} = - \frac{dU}{dx}\mathbf{i} - \frac{dU}{dy}\mathbf{j} - \frac{dU}{dz}\mathbf{k =}\frac{2\alpha}{c\varepsilon\varepsilon_{0}n}\left( \frac{dI}{dx}\mathbf{i +}\frac{dI}{dy}\mathbf{j +}\frac{dI}{dz}\mathbf{k} \right)$

**So the force always acts along the direction of increasing intensity gradient. Particles will therefore tend to move to regions of higher intensity.**

## Making a simple optical trap 

We saw in the last section that dielectric particles will tend to move
to regions of higher intensity in a laser beam. How can we use this to
create a simple optical trap? If we consider the intensity profile inside a laser beam, we find that it is not uniform across the beam, but instead it has a Gaussian shape as we move from the centre of the beam to the edges.

$$I = I_{0}\exp\left( - \frac{\left( x^{2} + y^{2} \right)}{2w_{0}^{2}} \right) = I_{0}\exp\left( - \frac{r^{2}}{2w_{0}^{2}} \right)$$

where $I_{0}$ is the intensity at the centre of the beam, $w_{0}$ is a measure of the beam width and r is the distance from the centre of the beam. This Gaussian profile means that an intensity gradient already exists within the laser beam and small dielectric particles will tend to be attracted and trapped in the centre of the beam.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/10_4.png" alt="gaussian laser beam" width="250" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 10.4 - The gaussian field strength of a laser beam. </em></p>
</div>

However, the problem of trapping along the axis of the laser beam (z
direction) still needs to be considered as no intensity gradient exists
for a coherent parallel beam. This difficulty can be overcome by
focussing the laser beam using a simple microscope objective lens.

When the light is focused, it creates a trap along the axis of the beam.
This is because the area of the beam decreases as it approaches the
focal plane and then increaeses after passing through it. This causes
the intensity to steadily increase and then decrease on passing through
the focal point of the lens.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/10_5.png" alt="trap in z" width="150" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 10.5 - When light is strongly focussed it makes a gradient along the z direction which traps the particle at the focus. </em></p>
</div>

The strength of the trap in the z direction can be varied by changing
the angle, $\theta$, (see diagram on left). The larger this angle, the steeper
the intensity gradient will be along the axis of the laser beam. The
maximum gradient in intensity can be obtained by using a lens with a
high numerical aperture (NA), where NA is defined as

$$NA = n\sin\theta$$

where n is the refractive index of the ambient environment.

**Trap stiffness (Quadratic approximation to beam profile)**

For small displacements from the central position we can approximate the Gaussian intensity profile of the beam using a quadratic function

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/10_6.png" alt="quadratic approx" width="350" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 10.6 - Quadratic approximation of the gaussian beam, which is valid for small displacements </em></p>
</div>

Laser Intensity:

$$I = I_{0}\exp\left( - \frac{r^{2}}{2w_{0}^{2}} \right) \approx I_{0}\left( 1 - \frac{r^{2}}{2w_{0}^{2}} \right)$$

Intensity gradient:

$$\frac{dI}{dr} = I_{0}\left( - \frac{r}{w_{0}^{2}} \right)$$

As we will see in the following examples, this allows us to determine
the effective spring constant (or stiffness) of the trap and to use
optical tweezers to measure forces that are exerted on trapped
particles.

For small displacements ($r << w_{o}$) the intensity profile can be
approximated by a quadratic form. This results in a force which is
directly proportional to the displacement of the particle within the
trap.

$F = - kr$

Where

$$k = \ \frac{2\alpha I_{0}}{c \epsilon \epsilon_{0} nw_{0}^{2}}$$

Hence, if we know the displacement and the trap stiffness, we can
calculate the force exerted on our trapped particle.

### Detection of particle movement

The split photodiode arrangement used in AFM can also be used to detect
deflections in optical traps. However, a quadrant photodiode is used to
detect deflections in both the x and y directions.

In the case of large particles, a shadow is cast on the quadrant
photodiode. This means that measured intensity varies as the particle
moves in the x-y plane.

For smaller particles, light scattered from the particle interferes with
light in the main beam to produce a fringe pattern on the photodiodes.
As the particle moves around, the fringe patterns move. This can also be
used to detect motion of the particle.

### Calibration of optical traps

There are 2 main techniques used to calibrate the spring constant or 'stiffness' of optical traps.

1. Measure the displacement of a particle under the influence of known forces.

$$k = \frac{F_{applied}}{x}$$

<div style="text-align: center;">

    <p><em>Figure 10.8 - Measure the displacement of particle due to known force to calibrate spring constant with Hooke's law</em></p>
</div>

2. Measure the mean square displacement, $\left<x^2\right>$, of a trapped particle under the influence of thermal motion.

$$k \approx \frac{k_{B}T}{\left\langle x^{2} \right\rangle}$$

### Force Measurements

It is possible to perform force measurements on e.g. single molecules. An optical trap and a fine micropipette can be used to measure the forces exerted by individual DNA molecules. Small polymer beads can be tethered to the ends of the molecule and used to manipulate it.
