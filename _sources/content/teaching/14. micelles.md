## Amphiphilic molecules

Amphiphiles are molecules which have a water soluble head group and a
hydrophobic tail group. The head group can be anionic (negatively
charged), cationic (positively charged) or uncharged. The tail group is
made up of a hydrocarbon chain.

    <p><em>Figure 16.1 - Amphiphile with charged hydrophilic headgroup and hydrophobic tail</em></p>
</div>

Amphiphiles are found in soaps, food stuffs, detergents, disinfectants
and can be found in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. They are also a major
component of human and animal cell membranes.

    <img src="imgs/14_2.png" alt="excluded volume" width="250" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 16.2 - Mayonnaise contains oil and water and yet is stabilised by a small amount of molecules found in egg which have amphiphilic properties. In contrast oil and water separate since oil is hydrophobic and water hydrophilic.</em></p>
</div>

When amphiphiles sit at the interface between water and oil these 2
liquids do not come into contact as much. This reduces or eliminates the
energy cost of the interface. This can be used to stabilise an interface
such as the oil-water emulsion of Mayonnaise.

    <img src="imgs/14_3.png" alt="oil and water" width="250" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 16.3 - Amphiphiles sit at the interface between oil (hydrophobic) and water (hydrophilic) minimising the interfacial energy cost.</em></p>
</div>

### The critical micelle concentration

When amphiphilic molecules are added to water at low concentrations,
they will initially disperse and some will migrate to the surface to
reduce the unfavourable contact between the hydrocarbon tails and the
water. The molecules exist as monomers.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/14_4.png" alt="critical micelle conc" width="250" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 16.4 - Above the critical micelle concentration amphiphiles start to form micelles in the bulk of a liquid. At this point they have completely coated the air-water interface.</em></p>
</div>

At a concentration called the **critical micelle concentration**
aggregates (or micelles) start to form in such a way that the
hydrophobic tails become shielded from the aqueous environment.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/14_5.png" alt="micelles" width="350" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 16.5 - A cylindrical and spherical micelle</em></p>
</div>

The free energy per molecule of amphiphiles in a micelle has a minimum
at a specific aggregation number. It is easy to see why this might be
the case.

When the micelles are too big, we must introduce amphiphiles into the
core of the structure. The unfavourable interactions between the
hydrophilic head groups of the molecules in the core and the tail groups
of surrounding amphiphiles have an energy penalty associated with them.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/14_6.png" alt="micelle too big" width="200" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 16.6 - If a spherical micelle is too big then amphiphiles must fill the gaps in the centre</em></p>
</div>

When micelles are too small, the
headgroups of the amphiphiles at the surface are unable to pack
efficiently enough to prevent water from contacting the hydrophobic tail
groups in the core of the micelle. This unfavourable interaction also
has an energy penalty associated with it.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/14_7.png" alt="micelle too small" width="150" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 16.7 - If a micelle is too small gaps appear which bring water into contact with the hydrophobic tails</em></p>
</div>

As a result of these interactions, the micelles that form in solution will tend to have a well defined size
which corresponds to the case when the amphililes are just able to pack together to ensure

1.  that no additional amphiphiles are introduced into the core of the micelle

2.  that the headgroups pack efficiently enough to shield the hydrophobic interior from water.

### Optimum headgroup area

There is an optimum headgroup area, $a_{0}$, occupied by an amphiphile at
the interface. This is determined by a balance between competing
contributions to the free energy. These contributions dominate at
different head group areas.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/14_9.png" alt="excluded volume" width="350" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 16.9 - Free energy as a function of headgroup area.</em></p>
</div>

1.  $a < a_{0}$: Electrostatic or steric repulsion between the head
    groups act to force neighbouring molecules apart.

2.  $a > a_{0}$: If the head groups are separated too much then
    hydrocarbon tails are exposed to water resulting in hydrophobic
    interactions.

### The hydrocarbon volume and critical chain length

1.  The hydrocarbon volume, ${\nu}$, is defined as the volume that is
    occupied by the hydrocarbon tails of the molecules.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/14_10.png" alt="critical chain length" width="100" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 16.10 - Critical chain length of an amphiphile</em></p>
</div>

2.  The critical chain length, $l_{c}$ , is the length of the hydrocarbon
    chain when it is fully extended.

It is important to realise that because of the definition of $l_{c}$ as
the maximum length of the amphiphile tail then it is **not** generally true that $a_{0}l_{c} = {\nu}$

### Factors affecting the shape of micelles

Amphiphiles are capable of forming many different shaped micelles
including spheres, cylinders and bi-layers. The fluid like nature of
these molecules means that we can determine the shape of micelles by
considering how the amphiphiles pack together.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/14_11.png" alt="shape micelle" width="400" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 16.11 - Micelles can form spherical, cylindrical or bilayer shapes</em></p>
</div>

To do this we just require 3 parameters:

The hydrocarbon volume, ${\nu}$, The critical chain length, $l_{c}$ The
optimum head group area, $a_{0}$.

### How do these parameters determine the shape of a micelle?

The critical chain length, $l_{c}$ , determines the size and shape of a
micelle as it sets the maximum length to which an individual amphiphile
molecule can be stretched

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/14_12.png" alt="determining shape" width="250" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 16.12 - The radius of a spherical micelle is determined by the critical chain length $l_{c}$</em></p>
</div>

Clearly the radius of any micelle that forms has to be less than or equal to this chain length.

$$R\  \leq l_{c}$$

### Critical packing parameter

The shape of a micelle depends on the critical packing parameter:

$$H = \ \frac{\nu}{l_{c}a_{0}}$$

In each case we can calculate the conditions through applying the same
steps:

1.  Calculate the number of amphiphiles in the micelle

    a. $N$ = surface area of micelle / $a_{0}$

    b. $N$ = volume of micelle / $\nu$

2.  Eliminate $N$ to obtain an expression for $R$ the radius of the micelle
    in terms of $\nu$ and $a_{0}$

3.  Substitute $R â‰¤ l_{c}$

4.  Rearrange to find the condition on the critical packing parameter

### Spherical micelles

The volume and surface area of a spherical micelle can be related to the
aggregation number, $N$, the hydrocarbon volume, $\nu$, and the optimum head
group area, $a_{0}$

If the radius of the micelle is less than the critical chain length, $l_{c}$ for spheres to form we require that

$$\ \frac{v}{l_{c}a_{0}}\  \leq \ \frac{1}{3}$$

### Cylinders

Similarly for cylindrical micelles:

$$\ \frac{1}{3} < \frac{v}{l_{c}a_{0}}\  \leq \ \frac{1}{2}$$

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/14_14.png" alt="cylindrical micelle" width="250" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 16.14 - A cylindrical micelle</em></p>
</div>

The $\frac{1}{3}$ comes from the fact that the spherical micelle (above) is more
energetically favourable than the cylinder, since the cylinder has
exposed ends with hydrophobic tails. However, when $H > \frac{1}{3}$ it is no
longer possible to form spheres.

### Bi-layers

Similarly for bi-layers:

$$\ \frac{1}{2} < \frac{v}{l_{c}a_{0}} $$

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="imgs/14_15.png" alt="bilayer" width="250" height=auto>
    <p><em>Figure 16.15 - A bi-layer</em></p>
</div>

Where in a similar way the $\frac{1}{2}$ originates from the fact that when $H$ is $\le \frac{1}{2}$
the amphiphiles will form cylinders.
