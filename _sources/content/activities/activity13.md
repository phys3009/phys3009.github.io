# Activity 13: Entropy and equilibrium separation

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../customstyle.css">

Two flat surfaces are brought into close proximity such that
dispersion forces attract them towards one another. One of the
surfaces is coated with a layer of rod-like molecules of length 3nm
arranged in a square grid, with the highest possible surface grafting
density that allows the free end of the molecules to rotate freely

1. Derive an expression for the magnitude of the
pressure exerted on the surfaces due to
repulsive steric (entropic) forces, assuming the rods are arranged in a square grid.

2. Calculate the equilibrium separation of the
surfaces at room temperature if the Hamaker
constant is $1{\times}10^{-20}J$ at $T=20^{\circ}C$ 

$$P_{dispersion} = \frac{A_{12}}{6{\pi}D^{3}}$$

If arranged in a square grid then a plan view will look like this:

From the lecture the force for a single rod is given by $F_{steric} = \frac{k_{B}T}{D}$ where $D$ is the distance between the surfaces, assuming that it is less than the length of the rods $l$.

$$P_{steric} = \frac{F}{d^{2}} = \frac{k_{B}T}{4l^{2}D}$$
