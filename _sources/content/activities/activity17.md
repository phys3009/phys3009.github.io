# Activity 17: When do membranes stick?

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../customstyle.css">

Membranes are sufficiently flexible that they fluctuate due to thermal energy. As 2 membranes come closer together the fluctuations are suppressed resulting in a repulsive entropic force. However, as always this force cannot be considered independently of at a minimum dispersion forces. We must therefore consider the balance between

1. A pressure due to dispersion interactions 

2. A pressure that arises from suppressing these fluctuations

The graph below shows the pressure due to both these curves and the sum of the two. If you need to you can pan and zoom to see the features of the graph more clearly.

Using the sliders you can adjust the strength of 3 key parameters: The Hamaker constant, the membrane stiffness and the Temperature.

- Identify which curve is due to dispersion interactions and which is due to the entropic repulsion.

- Why do you not get a secondary minimum as you did with the DLVO potential for charged plates and colloids?

- What is the effect of increasing the membrane stiffness and why?

- What effect does increasing the temperature have and why?
