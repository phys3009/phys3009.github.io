Water molecules form hydrogen bonds, which are much stronger than dispersion forces (Ammonia just has dispersion forces). A hydrogen bond is about $12 k_{B}T$ whereas a dispersion force might be $\sim 2 k_{B}T$. Hydrogen bonds occur when a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom (like oxygen in water) is attracted to another electronegative atom in a different molecule.  Inorder for a liquid to boil it needs to overcome the hydrogen bonds holding it together as a liquid. For a given temperature the probability of breaking a bond is determined by the Boltzmann probability $P(x) \propto \exp\left(\frac{-U}{k_{B}T}\right)$. This is going to be a much smaller probability for H-bonds than dispersion forces. As a result you'll need a much higher temperature to get water to boil than Ammonia.
