# Activity 8: blowing bubbles

You are blowing a bubble through a straw into water. 

1. Sketch qualitatively what happens to the magnitude of the Laplace pressure as the bubble increases in size.

2. If the straw has a diameter of $1mm$ and the surface tension of water is $72mNmm^{-1}$ estimate the maximum magnitude of the Laplace pressure.

1. Consider what happens to the radius of curvature of the bubble as it is being blown. It  starts off very large, goes through a minimum and then increases again:

  <div style="text-align: center;">

  </div>

We know the pressure in the bubble is set by the Laplace pressure which is given by:

$${\Delta}P = {\gamma}\left[\frac{1}{r_{1}}+\frac{1}{r_{2}}\right]$$

Since the bubble is spherical we have $r_{1} = r_{2} = r$ and the Laplace pressure becomes:

$${\Delta}P = \frac{2\gamma}{r}$$

We expect the pressure to look something like this:

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

2. Maximum pressure occurs when $r$ is the same as the radius of the straw. 

$${\Delta}P = \frac{2 \times 72\times10^{-3}}{0.5\times10^{-3}} = 288Pa$$
