# Activity 16: Freezing ice cream

If you allow ice cream to partially defrost and then stick it back in the freezer youâ€™ll find that it tastes icy and less creamy. This is because the taste buds in your mouth tell your brain that smaller crystals are more creamy and tasty.

Think about what you have learnt and how it applies to this problem.

1. Why are there no small ice crystals?

2. Why are the final ice crystals much bigger?

  Initially we have a tight distribution of ice crystals. When we heat the system by leaving ice cream outside all the ice crystals decrease in size through melting. However, the smallest ice crystals melt enough to disappear. This means there are now a smaller number of ice crystals than before. 

  When we re-freeze the ice cream there are two options:

  1. Homogeneous nucleation of new crystals

  2. Growth of existing crystals

  We know that option 1 is very unlikely because it relies on a chance fluctuation to overcome the barrier to nucleation. Heterogeneous nucleation by growing on preexisting crystals has a much smaller free energy barrier. As a result the crystals grow bigger because the molecules rejoining the crystals are shared between fewer crystals.
