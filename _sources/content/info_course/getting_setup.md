## Getting Setup - Quickstart

A much more detailed guide to getting setup is included at the start of the first teaching session's notes. This page provides a brief overview.

If you are taking this course in person at Nottingham the workshops will use computers already containing the necessary software. However, if doing the sessions remotely or setting up your own computer for work outside the sessions you will need to install the following:

Install:
- <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">miniconda</a> or <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html">anaconda</a>.
- <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">git</a>
- <a href="https://cli.github.com/">github cli</a>
- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">vscode</a>

You will need to create a <a href="https://github.com/join">github account</a>. If attending in person we will do this in the first session (see details in teaching notes for session 1). Registration with github classroom can then be done by clicking on an email link to the first weeks files. This will be sent out in the week commencing [WelcomeDate]. If you do not receive this link please [contact me][MIS].

On vscode you should <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#:~:text=You%20can%20browse%20and%20install,on%20the%20VS%20Code%20Marketplace.">install a few extensions.</a>

- python (required)
