-	To help students develop an appreciation of the role of intermolecular, interparticle and surface forces in nanoscale science, technology and biology.

## Assessment

Examination 100%:

-	In the summer assessment period.
-	In person, closed book
-	2 hrs to complete paper
-	Access to an equation sheet containing some key equations. This will be available in advance

## Using this guide {#using-this-guide .H2}

The material in this module is drawn from a range of different sources
making it difficult to recommend a single textbook that is written at
the appropriate level that covers the material. As such I have put
together these companion notes which function like a textbook for the
course. All the material is covered in the same order as the course.
Some students prefer written rather than oral explanations, and
sometimes it is quicker and easier to look up / remind yourself about
something specific in a sequential written text. **You shouldn't
therefore feel you need to read this guide cover to cover**, rather use
it to complement the rest of your studies, looking up bits that perhaps
you are unclear on or need to go over more slowly.

## Questions? {#questions .H2}

If you are stuck on any part of this course, try reading through the
appropriate part here but if you are still struggling to understand,
here are the options:

1.  I'm always happy to answer questions during or immediately after
    lectures.

2.  Every written question I answer from students will be posted to the
    Q&A forum of the Moodle page, so it is worth having a look there in
    case your question has already been addressed. If you want to see
    all questions and answers you may subscribe to this feature.

3.  If your question is not already listed then please email me your
    question at:

> I'm always happy to answer your questions and will usually get back to
> you in 1-2 working days. I will reply directly to your question and
> post in an anonymized way with the corresponding answer. I prefer to
> do this since then your question can then benefit others.
