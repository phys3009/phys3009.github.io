# How to study this course

## Making a Plan

Getting organised about your studies is by far the biggest thing you can do to improve your outcome from this and any module. A few people find this comes naturally to them, the rest of us have to be more deliberate about it. We all have different strengths and weaknesses, so if this is something you find tricky click on the link below to a resource helping you to think through your learning differences:

It takes less than 20 minutes and is a good investment. Spend a bit of time thinking about what you can implement to help yourself. Be specific. e.g. I'm going to get some exercise every Thursday evening as it helps my mental health. I'm going to review my notes and do the activities on a Monday at 3pm.

## Resources for learning each week

- *Core Content* - Each week you have 2 lectures. These cover all the material I expect you to know. The powerpoint slides are available as a pdf for each lecture.

- *Activities* -  Each week has problems or activities that test your understanding and I believe will be helpful to you in studying the course. I would suggest you do these towards the end of the week as some will rely on the second lecture in the week to complete.

- *OneNote* - The Class Onenote book. Everything I write in lectures goes into this, so you have a record of solutions and derivations performed in the lecture, so don't worry if you fail to copy everything. To get access to this. You need to:

- *Taking it further (optional)* - In this final section I want to show you something of how this Physics helps you understand the world around you or give you insight into some current research that you might find interesting. Lets be frank I know that you are busy so this might not be top of your priority list. That's fine nothing in here is important to help you pass the exam but there is more to Physics than passing exams so in my wild optimism I've added these sections anyway! 

- *Math's resources (optional)* - Some people find involved maths a bit hard to follow in a lecture. The difficulty is that if you miss a bit, then there is no easy way to catch up. I have included some videos of these more involved bits within the course. This just repeats what's in the lecture so no need to go through this unless you missed something. The main aim is to give you the flexibility to learn in a way that is best suited to your own style and needs.
