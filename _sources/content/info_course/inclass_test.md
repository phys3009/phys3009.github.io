## The in-class test

The in-class test is only undertaken by those students on a taught masters course. MPAGS students get a week off to work on their projects.

The in-class test will take place in person in the 6th week of the course. The test wil be carried out on university desktops running specialist software. The nature of the test will be solving a series of questions in a Jupyter notebook. This will be very similar to the exercises that you undertake each week (except the tests will not be visible).

The test will take place under controlled conditions, meaning that you will <u>not</u> be allowed to confer, use ai tools, google searches or other digital devices. However, you <u>will</u> be allowed to use the course notes, have access to your previous exercises. The test will also provide links to the official documentation of any function you are expected to use.

The test will last 1 hour. **If you have a support plan which allows extra time please [contact Mike]("mailto:mike.i.smith@nottingham.ac.uk") in advance of the test**.

**It is very important that you attend class in the weeks just prior to the test as we will be double checking that you are setup correctly on a PC and that everything is working**. Prior to releasing the test on the day we will also run a check. We will not start the test until we have confirmed that everyone has a working setup / conda environment.
