# How to study this course

## Making a Plan

Getting organised about your studies is by far the biggest thing you can do to improve your outcome from this and any module. A few people find this comes naturally to them, the rest of us have to be more deliberate about it. We all have different strengths and weaknesses, so if this is something you find tricky click on the link below to a resource helping you to think through your learning differences:

It takes less than 20 minutes and is a good investment. Spend a bit of time thinking about what you can implement to help yourself. Be specific. e.g. I'm going to get some exercise every Thursday evening as it helps my mental health. I'm going to review my notes and do the activities on a Monday at 3pm.

The guide begins with the *About this course* section where you should find answers to general questions about the course, information about the assessment and also some important resources to support your well-being.

Following this the guide is arranged week by week to mirror the course as it is delivered in lectures. Each week contains notes that cover the content of the lectures; activities to boost your understanding of the covered material and also additional resources such as videos of the more maths heavy content.

## Lecture notes

Each week, there is a chapter to accompany each lecture. At the top of each of these lecture note pages you'll see a special section which links you to all the other important resources in the course:

1. **Re-watch lecture** - all my lectures are recorded and can be re-watched at the echo360 site

2. **Open Notebook** - in lectures I write everything in a onenote book which you have access to. This means you don't have to worry if you miss something. There is also a print out of all the ppt slides in your own section of the notebook so you can annotate these in the lectures if you have access to a digital device.

3. **Download Slides** - this is a pdf copy of the Powerpoint slides which you can download.

The material that follows covers the same material as the lectures in the same order as the course. Some students prefer written rather than oral explanations, and sometimes it is quicker and easier to look up / remind yourself about something specific in a sequential written text. You shouldnâ€™t therefore feel you need to read this guide cover to cover, rather use it to complement the rest of your studies, looking up bits that perhaps you are unclear on or need to go over more slowly.

## Activities

Each week has activities, which are designed to stimulate your thinking and help you check you are understanding the material. I'd really recommend planning to complete these each week as we go along rather than saving them for the end of the course.

## Math

Some weeks the lectures have some pretty involved calculations or derivations. I believe it's important for you to see these but I recognise it can be hard to follow in a lecture. If you don't understand something it can then be hard to folow the rest. These pages contain videos of the same calculations with me explaining things again. The aim is that after the lecture you can pause / replay the video to help you understand.

This content replicates exactly what is in the lectures and so if you understood during the lecture you can skip this section.

## Taking it further

This section is aimed at helping you to satisfy your curiosity. It tries to expand and explore connections to novel research papers or phenomena. This is a purely optional section of the course but I hope you find it stimulates your interest.
