# Using this guide

The guide begins with the *About this course* section where you should find answers to general questions about the course, information about the assessment and also some important resources to support your well-being.

Following this the guide is arranged week by week to mirror the course as it is delivered in lectures. Each week contains notes that cover the content of the lectures; activities to boost your understanding of the covered material and also additional resources such as videos of the more maths heavy content.

## Lecture notes

At the top of each of these pages you'll see a special section which links you to all the other important resources in the course:

1. Re-watch lecture - all my lectures are recorded and can be re-watched at the echo360 site

2. Open Notebook - in lectures I write everything in a onenote book which you have access to in the _content section. This means you don't have to worry if you miss something. There is also a print out of all the ppt slides in your own section of the notebook so you can annotate these in the lectures if you have access to a digital device.

3. Download Slides - this is a pdf copy of the Powerpoint slides which you can download.

The material that follows covers the same material as the lectures in the same order as the course. Some students prefer written rather than oral explanations, and sometimes it is quicker and easier to look up / remind yourself about something specific in a sequential written text. You shouldn’t therefore feel you need to read this guide cover to cover, rather use it to complement the rest of your studies, looking up bits that perhaps you are unclear on or need to go over more slowly.

## Activities

Each week has activities, which are designed to stimulate your thinking and help you check you are understanding the material. I'd really recommend planning to complete these each week as we go along rather than saving them for the end of the course.

## Math

Some weeks the lectures have some pretty involved calculations or derivations. I believe it's important for you to see these but I recognise it can be hard to follow in a lecture. If you don't understand something it can then be hard to folow the rest. These pages contain videos of the same calculations with me explaining things again. The aim is that after the lecture you can pause / replay the video to help you understand.

This content replicates exactly what is in the lectures and so if you understood during the lecture you can skip this section.

## Taking it further

This section is aimed at helping you to satisfy your curiosity. It tries to expand and explore connections to novel research papers or phenomena. This is a purely optional section of the course but I hope you find it stimulates your interest.

## Questions?

If you are stuck on any part of this course, try reading through the appropriate part here but if you are still struggling to understand, here are the options:

1.	I’m always happy to answer questions during or immediately after lectures.
2.	Every written question I answer from students will be posted to the Q&A forum of the Moodle page, so it is worth having a look there in case your question has already been addressed. If you want to see all questions and answers you may subscribe to this feature.
3.	If your question is not already listed then please email me your question at: 

mike.i.smith@nottingham.ac.uk 
I’m always happy to answer your questions and will usually get back to you in 1-2 working days. I will reply directly to your question and post in an anonymized way with the corresponding answer. I prefer to do this since then your question can then benefit others.

## Which textbook should I use?

The material in this module is drawn from a range of different sources making it difficult to recommend a single textbook that is written at the appropriate level that covers the material. As such I have put together the notes here which function like a textbook for the course (and save you some cash!).
