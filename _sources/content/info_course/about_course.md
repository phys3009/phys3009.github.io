# About the course

Force and function at the Nanoscale is a 10 credit course which runs in the Spring semester.

## Whats the course about?

The course aims to provide an introduction to physics at the nanoscale system. At these scales, the forces that dominate are different to those we are used to in the macroscopic world. Thermal energy becomes a critical factor in determining the behaviour of systems and the forces that act between objects. These forces are important in a wide range of applications from the behaviour of biological systems to the design of new materials.

## What, when and where?

The course starts on 29th Jan and has two timetabled sessions each week:

- Wednesday 9-10am in Chemistry X2
- Friday 12-1pm in Chemistry X2

In addition I run a weekly office hour (C126 in the main physics building) on X from Y-Z. This is also available on Teams (If you have not been correctly added to the team <a href="mailto:mike.i.smith@nottingham.ac.uk">send me an email</a>).

## Assessment

The course is assessed entirely through an examination:

-   In the summer assessment period.

-   In person, closed book

-   2 hrs to complete paper

-   Access to an equation sheet containing some key equations.

## Questions?

If you are stuck on any part of this course, try reading through the appropriate sections of this guide but if you are still struggling to understand, here are the options:

1.	I’m always happy to answer questions during or immediately after lectures.
2.	Every written question I answer from students will be posted to the Q&A forum of the Moodle page, so it is worth having a look there in case your question has already been addressed. If you want to see all questions and answers you may subscribe to this feature.
3.	If your question is not already listed then please <a href="mailto:mike.i.smith@nottingham.ac.uk">email me your question</a>. I’m always happy to answer your questions and will usually get back to you in 1-2 working days. I will reply directly to your question and post in an anonymized way with the corresponding answer. I prefer to do this since then your question can then benefit others.
4. I also run a weekly office hour (C126 in the main physics building). This is also available on Teams (If you have not been correctly added to the team <a href="mailto:mike.i.smith@nottingham.ac.uk">please email me</a>)


## Which textbook should I use?

The material in this module is drawn from a range of different sources making it difficult to recommend a single textbook that is written at the appropriate level that covers the material. As such I have put together the notes here which function like a textbook for the course (and save you some cash!).
