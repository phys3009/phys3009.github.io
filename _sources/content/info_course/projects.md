# Projects

The projects will be available from week 3 and are designed to be extended pieces of work
produced largely independently. The project type and assessment varies depending on how you are taking this course so please read the relevant sections carefully.

## Choosing a Topic

### Taught Masters

Students doing the taught masters **should <u>not</u> use machine learning in
your project**.

We provide a choice of 3 “starting points” for your project. Each project contains
some basic starter code, a bit of background information and some templates for the
submission. Choose a project which piques your interest. Whilst each project provides
access to an interesting source of data it is up to you to decide how to develop the project.
We suggest coming up with a “scenario” (see individual projects for a few suggestions /
examples). With that scenario in mind, we’d like you to think about how you could create a
tool that would enable someone to easily interact with the data and extract something
meaningful to them. Perhaps a way to visualise and interact with the data graphically or a
set of functions and classes with a demo usage, that simplify extracting meaning from the
data.  Try to design your code so that it could be easily reused or adapted for broader
related purposes beyond the one outlined in your scenario.

### Research degrees (PhD or Masters)

For those working on research degrees (PhD or Masters) you are welcome to choose any
topic you like, but we would suggest picking something that may be helpful for your
research. Please use the instructions for the taught masters project as a guide for what is
required. The restriction around machine learning for the taught masters project students
does not apply. Please also use the template for submission to assist us in giving you useful
feedback.

### Project Code Guidelines

All the starter materials for the projects are supplied as an assignment, which you can
synchronise in the same way you do with the exercises each week. If you use multiple
computers please be careful to synchronise your files at the start and end of each session.
You can work on and get help from staff during the workshops each week and we are happy to discuss both the overall shape of your project and the details of trying to get specifics to work. 

Prior to submission please delete the files associated with the projects you decide not to use.
We would prefer submissions as a Jupyter Notebook (*.ipynb). **A template Jupyter notebook
is provided that you can use**. This should not only provide code but be structured with
Markdown cells which explain:

- The aim of the project / scenario and the problem it is solving
- A high level overview in words of how the code works
- A discussion of design decisions taken in structuring the code.
- How would you develop / improve the code if given more time?

However, we are aware that some code eg guis, does not work well in Jupyter notebooks. If
this is the case:

- you should provide a `main.py` file which runs your code.
- include any tests in a separate .py file.
- Provide a pdf which covers the points above. As a guide we’d expect ~ 300-500
words.

In both formats, additional code / modules can also be included in other python files in the
same repository if necessary and then imported. Make sure you use relative imports in your
code.

**Please make every effort to structure your code in a logical fashion to assist us in
understanding it**

In addition to the Jupyter Notebook / code files you should also submit:

- a Conda environment file which enables your code to be run. Please ensure you test
this on a Windows machine.
- any output that cannot easily be embedded in the notebook (e.g an example data file
or some visualisation, pdfs)

Your program should (as a rough guide):

- do something meaningful within the context of your scenario
- define at least two user functions (but typically more)
- make use of appropriate specialist modules
- comprise >~ 50 lines of actual code (excluding comments, imports and other
‘boilerplate’)
- contain no more than 1000 lines in total (if you have written more, please isolate an
individual element)

### Referencing sources

No one builds their computer programmes from scratch. At the very least pre-written
compilers/interpreters turn high-level code into machine-level instructions. Typically we use
many built-in functions, modules and packages. However, it should always be clear which
modules you have imported. The assumption will be that the contents of such modules do
not constitute part of your submission, unless their code is included in your submission.
Furthermore, it is common practice to refer to code provided in documentation, examples,
Q&A sites, and open source repositories, in the course of developing one's own code. If you
wish to directly include code from another source, you must clearly indicate its origin.
Preferably, such code should be put it in a separate file, and imported into your own code in
the same manner as any other standard-library or third-party module.

It is best practice to draw from multiple resources to instruct the creation of your own
original code. However, where you do copy or adapt significant portions of code from a
specific source and incorporate it in your own work, you should make it explicit that you
have done so, and indicate where the original code came from, by commenting the code in
an obvious manner.

Appropriate use of third-party code, eg specialist modules is encouraged and recognised
positively in marking. However, we expect such material to be combined with significant
amounts of your own code, to produce an original solution. We will also be looking for
evidence that you understand your entire code at reasonable level.
Note that we actively attempt to detect where code has been taken verbatim, or with
trivial changes, from online sources or other student's work and used without declaration.
