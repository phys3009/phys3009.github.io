## Academic integrity

You must have completed your academic integrity training (at the start of the academic year) before submitting coursework. More specific guidance for this module is given below.

## Computer code

No one builds their computer programmes from scratch. At the very least pre-written compilers/interpreters turn high-level code into machine-level instructions. Typically we use many built-in functions, modules and packages. However, it should always be clear which modules you have imported. The assumption will be that the contents of such modules do not constitute part of your submission, unless their code is included in your submission.

Furthermore, it is common practice to refer to code provided in documentation, examples, Q&A sites, and open source repositories, in the course of developing one's own code. If you wish to directly include code from another source, you must clearly indicate its origin. Preferably, such code should be put it in a separate file, and imported it into your own code in the same manner as any other standard-library or third-party module.

It is best practice to draw from multiple resources to instruct the creation of your own original code. However, where you do copy or adapt significant portions of code from a specific source and incorporate it in your own work, you should make it explicit that you have done so, and indicate where the original code came from, by commenting the code in an obvious manner.

Appropriate use of third-party code is encouraged and recognised positively in marking. However, we expect such material to be combined with significant amounts of your own code, to produce an original solution. We will also be looking for evidence that you understand your entire code at reasonable level.

Note that we actively attempt to detect where code has been taken verbatim, or with trivial changes, from online sources or other student's work.

## Academic integrity statement

Each file of code you submit must contain the following statement as a comment at the top of the file:

I, [your name], have read and understood the School's Academic Integrity Policy, as well as guidance relating to this module, and confirm that this submission complies with the policy. The content of this file is my own original work, with any significant material copied or adapted from other sources clearly indicated and attributed.
