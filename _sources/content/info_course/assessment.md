### Assessment details and criteria for PGT students

The assessment for PGT students will consist of two parts:

1. a short viva ~ 5-10 mins (20%)
2. the project submission (45%)

The short viva: (5-10 mins) with members of staff will be held during the week commencing the
**25th November**. It will concern your project as it currently is (we
understand you will not have finished it at this point, but please ensure an up-to-date
version of the project is available at the end of the previous week). The only preparation
necessary for this viva is to ensure you are familiar with your project. The viva will take the
form of a code review. You’ll be asked questions about your code, design decisions and
alternative approaches you might have taken.
The project submission: projects must be submitted in their final form by
**Wednesday December 11th (5pm)** In assessing the projects we will be looking at the following
features:

- Does it show a good grasp of python?
- Does the code tackle the stated scenario well?
- Is there evidence of self-driven learning (e.g incorporating relevant new modules)?
- Does it demonstrate a novel approach to the stated problem?
- Is the code “clean” and appropriately documented and therefore easy to follow?
- Does it evidence good design decisions in the way it is structured?
- Does it have a set of appropriate tests?
- Does the description in the accompanying markdown / report indicate an ability to
explain what is being done and why?

Whilst we ask you to come up with a scenario for your project, we are not assessing this
directly, and don’t want you to be too concerned about what you choose. Any sensible
scenario that provides a direction / goal for your project and a non-trivial problem to solve is
acceptable. We ultimately would like you to pick something that you think would be fun and
interesting to work on, and fires your imagination. Hopefully reading through the examples
next to each project will demonstrate what we mean, but if you are still concerned please
discuss this with us early on.

#### Viva – 20% of module grade

<b>80+%</b> They can articulate both the way in which their code works and the reasons for
choosing such an approach with superb clarity. When asked questions about their code they
are adept in explaining the particulars and logic of small sections and the overview high-level
design decisions made. They can extremely clearly reason about alternative approaches they
may have taken, other projects that could be solved and how, and outline the pros and cons.

<b>60+%</b> They able to explain how their code works, and the reasons for choosing such an
approach with in a comprehensible way (though follow up questioning might be required to
draw this out). When asked questions about their code they can explain logic of small
sections and the why the code is organised in a particular way. With some prompting, they
can reason about alternative approaches they may have taken, outline the pros and cons or
suggest how their code might be applied to a related problem.

<b>40+%</b> It is hard to understand from the explanations given how the code works at either
small or larger scale. It is not always obvious that the student understands it well. They
struggle to suggest how things might have been done differently or the code applied to a
different but related problem.

#### Code submission - 45% of module grade

<b>80+%</b> Excellent code, which addresses the (sufficiently meaningful) problem identified in
the scenario in a readable, efficient and elegant manner, making excellent use of appropriate
Python language elements and modules. If the implementation is incomplete, this is clear.

<b>60+%</b> Good code, which mostly addresses the (sufficiently meaningful) problem identified
in the report in a fairly readable and efficient manner, making use of appropriate Python
language elements and modules. It is reasonably clear where the implementation is
incomplete.

<b>40+%</b> Poor code, which barely addresses the (possibly rather simplistic) problem identified
in the report, in a manner that is difficult to comprehend and possibly very inefficient. Poor
use of appropriate Python language elements and modules.
