## Assessment

This course is assessed via a single exam (100%):

-	In the summer assessment period.
-	In person, closed book
-	2 hrs to complete paper
-	Access to an equation sheet containing some key equations. This will be available in advance

## How to prepare and what to expect

If you've been working through the activities as we've gone along you should have a reasonable grasp of the course by the time you get to this point. If you haven't done them, that would be a good place to start.

Try and make a condensed set of notes, the process of sifting will help you understand and remember things better. 

In exams you'll be asked to demonstrate several different abilities:

**Conceptual knowledge** - I expect you to have a good qualitative understanding of key features we've covered. e.g mechanisms behind dispersion interactions, hydrophobic effect, entropy; explaining phenomena that are new to you in terms of ideas we've covered e.g Ice cream left out of the freezer having bigger crystals, Mercury going down rather than up with capillary rise; sketching the form of a potential.

**Mathematical ability** - When deriving results focus on understanding the key assumptions that go into a particular derivation. You won't be asked for the exact same problem in an exam but some variation. e.g adding up dispersion interactions for a different geometry. This might also involve recognising the similarity between a problem and one you have already studied, changing the boundary conditions.

**Numerical** - This is usually easy marks where you will be asked to numerically evaluate an expression by putting in numbers. However, students often make simple mistakes by not knowing how to convert between different units etc. Connected with this is understanding and expressing what the number means for a problem. Often this is as simple as recognising that a negative number is an attractive force or that the value is less than $k_{B}T$ and so insignificant.

Once you are reasonably confident, have a go at one of the sample exam papers. Do it as if it was the real thing. Do three questions in 120 minutes and then after a break use the mark scheme to evaluate what you've done well, gaps in your knowledge etc. Pay attention to exam technique. Were there things you could have written down that would have given you more marks? e.g converting numbers into the correct units, stating $F=-\frac{dU}{dD}$ often gets you a mark in a question even if you are clueless about the rest of it! Do some more focussed revision before continuing to the next one.

Finally and importantly, living a balanced well adjusted life is more important than an extra few marks. It's normal to feel a bit anxious and stressed as you approach an exam. If you are struggling with your emotions and feeling stressed, this is a great initial resource to hopefully help you keep things in perspective:
