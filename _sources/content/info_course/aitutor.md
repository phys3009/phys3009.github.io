# AI tutor

This page gives the resources and info to setup a kind of AI tutor that will help you with this course. 

```{warning}
Like all AI tools it is extremely experimental. I have spent considerable time evaluating it and I think it could be extremely helpful to you but it is not always going to get everything right. Please watch my tutorial on how to set it up and use it. 
```

I am really excited by tech and I think this is potentially a really valuable resource for you. This is far better than using a standard AI tool like ChatGPT because it is focussed on my course and notes. I would really appreciate your feedback as I pilot this. 

## Setting up the AI tutor and using it

This video covers setting up and some tips for using the AI tutor. This is not difficult and doesn't require any specialist skills. If you have a google account and a web browser you are good to go.

## Listen to the podcast here

The AI tutor creates a podcast. You might just want to listen to it without the setup above. You can do that from the player below:

The podcast is a bit cheesy and slightly comical but having listened to it I feel its quite accurate and helpful.
