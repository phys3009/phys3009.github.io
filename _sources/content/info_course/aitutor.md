# AI tutor

```{warning}
The AI tutor is experimental. I have vetted it as best I can and I think it is a resource that can help you, but it should be used in addition to the mainstream resources not as a substitute. Please watch my video which explains how to use it and gives you some ideas about how to get the most out of it.

The AI tutor needs you to register with me a google account email. You should have received an invitation via Teams / Outlook if you are registered on the course but you can also <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/uCvhPxYcfg">register through this link</a>

Please watch this video, introducing you to the AI tutor.

You can also listen to the slightly comical but also relatively accurate ai generated audio podcast.
