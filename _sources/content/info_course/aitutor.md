# AI tutor

This page gives the resources and info to setup a kind of AI tutor that will help you with this course. It is not necessary to use and it only helps you to explore the other resources I have produced, but you may find it helpful.

```{warning}
I have spent considerable time evaluating it and I think it could be extremely helpful to you but it is always possible it will make mistakes. However, in my experience because of the way this tool works you will get much better answers than a conventional ai. Please watch my tutorial on how to set it up and use it. 
```

I am really excited by tech and I think this is potentially a really valuable resource for you. This is far better than using a standard AI tool like ChatGPT because it is focussed on my course and notes. It also enables you to check where in my course notes it is finding the answers that it gives you enabling you to check.

## Setting up the AI tutor and using it

This first video covers setting up the AI tutor. This is not difficult and doesn't require any specialist skills. If you have a google account and a web browser you are good to go.

## Listen to the podcast here

The AI tutor creates a podcast. You might just want to listen to it without the setup above. You can do that from the player below:

The podcast is a bit cheesy and slightly comical but having listened to it I feel its quite accurate and helpful.

## Ai generated summary videos of different course sections

These are not perfect but as a quick overview of the key concepts I think they are helpful and memorable.
