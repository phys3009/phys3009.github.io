# Scientific Programming in Python Course - University of Nottingham (PHYS4038 & AS1)

Welcome to the scientific programming in python course at the University of Nottingham. This postgraduate course is designed to give a general introduction to the Python programming language and its wider ecosystem, with a focus on the elements most
important for data analysis and scientific research.

The course is aimed at students on the <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pgstudy/courses/physics-and-astronomy/machine-learning-in-science-msc.aspx">MSc Machine Learning in Science</a> 
programme at the University of Nottingham for which it is <a href="https://moodle.nottingham.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=135414">PHYS4038</a> as well as
first-year PhD students at the University of Nottingham and a number of other
institutions, via the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/mpags">Midland Physics Alliance Graduate School</a> for which it is <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/mpags/modules/comp/python">AS1</a>.  Students taking this module are expected to have a limited level of prior programming experience, but not necessarily in python.
